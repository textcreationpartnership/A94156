            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:172730:5"/>am preſented, hath not half a maintenance, nor ſo much as a houſe belonging to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but the Lord hath given you ſuch compaſſion to Souls, that you have given me both a convenient dwelling, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable maintenance (beſides the Tythes, above ſeventy pound <hi>per annum,</hi> out of your own inheritance) that I enjoy, through the good hand of my God upon me, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent encouragement, and comfortable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. When others refuſe to draw out their purſes to hungry bodies, the gracious God hath enabled you both to draw out your purſe and hearts unto ſtarving ſouls: Soul-charity is the higheſt and nobleſt charity, and <hi>ſuch fruit</hi> as will much <hi>abound to your account at the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 4.17. Hereby, like wiſe Merchants, you return your riches into the other world by bills of Exchange. How much are you both in debted to free Grace! Vſually the richeſt mines are covered with the moſt barren earth; and men who receive much from God very quietly (like narrow mouth'd glaſſes) will part with nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtir and reluctancy.

               <hi>Be much with God in Religious duties.</hi> Secret praying, reading and meditating, are great helps to piety. The bottom of a Chriſtians building is underground, and out of the Worlds ſight: The greateſt part of that trade which a Saint drives with God, is unſeen, and his returns are unknown to the world. Chriſt giveth his ſweeteſt kiſſes and deareſt embraces to his Spouſe, when ſhe is <hi>alone. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> met with the bleſſing when he had parted with his company, and wraſtled ſingly with the <hi>Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Bread eaten in ſecret, how ſweet is it!</hi> When God meeteth thy ſoul in a morning, or evening prayer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Majeſtie will be ſweet to thee indeed.</p>
            <p>Take heed of omiſſion of duties in the Cloſet. The <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite</hi> had not eaten in three days who was nigh death.

When the nights are long, the days are very cold; when there are long omiſſions of duties, godlineſs will cool. Ah, didſt thou but know what many a Saint hath gained by that hidden calling, I am confident thou wouldſt mind it, what ever thou didſt omit. Remember how often and earneſtly I have urged thee to this duty. It is thy priviledge that though thou canſt not every day have the ſhowres of publick Ordinances, yet mayſt thou have the watering-pots of ſecret duties to make thy ſoul fruitful. Let no day paſs without thy morning and evening Sacrifices. Faſting is bad for ſome bodies, I am

Now what great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between the <hi>death of the ſoul</hi> by <hi>ſtabbing</hi> and by <hi>ſtarving.</hi> If thy ſoul dye eternally it will be little comfort to thee to plead that thou didſt not drink or ſwear as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Satan the crooked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is ever buſie to poiſon the Air in thine houſe, and thereby to deſtroy thy ſelf, ſervants and whole houſhold; the only ſtone for prevention is to ſet up Religion. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, I have many a time preſſed this duty upon thee, and I do again in the name of the bleſſed God charge thee, as thou wilt anſwer it at the Bar of Chriſt, that thou immediately ſet up the worſhip of God in thy Family. Thou knoweſt how many Sermons I preached from <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. on this
<pb facs="tcp:172730:20"/>ſubject, all which ere long thou ſhalt give an account of; how inexcuſable wilt thou be if after all thoſe warnings thy Family be found in the number of them that call not on God! Good Lord, how dreadful will it be for thee to ſink into hell with thy whole houſe on thy back!</p>
            <p>And now Reader, whoever thou art, out of affection to thy precious ſoul and eternal ſalvation, let me prevail with thee not to uſe Religion as men do perfumes, refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them whilſt they have them, but they can well enough be without them, but to make it thy chief, and main and principal buſineſs. What ſhall I ſay to thee? Aſſure thy ſelf, Religion will be thy beſt friend at laſt. O if thou hadſt but the ſame apprehenſions of it now which thou wilt have on a dying bed, and day of Judgement, thou wouldſt make it thine only buſineſs; them Religion will be Religion indeed, &amp; of infinitely more worth to thee then millions of worlds; All other things will then, like leaves in Autumn, fall from thee; but though all thy moſt loving friends will part with thee, Religion will walk with thee in the <hi>valley of the ſhadow of death;</hi> it will direct and refreſh thee in the pleaſant waters of life, and it will protect and comfort thee in thoſe ſalt waters of ſickneſs, and when thou paſſeſt the <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> the <hi>Sea of death.</hi> When the world, in thy extremity will ſerve thee as the herd do a Deer that is ſhot, puſh thee out of their company. When thy wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will, like <hi>Orpah</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> kiſs thee, and take their leave of thee, Religion will, like <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſtick cloſs to thee, <hi>where thou goeſt it will go; where thou lodgeſt it will lodge; death it ſelf ſhall not part thee and it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the noble Grecian anſwered <hi>Philip</hi> when he asked him <hi>Whether he was not afraid to die? No,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians will give me a life that is immortal.</hi> Thou ſhouldſt not need to fear death; for Religion will give thee a life that is immortal. As the old grave Counſellors told <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boham, Be thou a ſervant to this people this day, and they will be thy ſervants for ever.</hi> So ſay I to thee, <hi>Be thou but a
<pb facs="tcp:172730:20"/>faithful ſervant to Religion in this ſhort day of thy life, and Religion will be thy ſervant to all eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou art reſolved to give thy ſelf up to the ſervice of this noble Miſtris, poſſibly this Treatiſe may do thee ſome little ſervice, by acquainting thee with her will, and directing thee in her work.</p>
            <p>If in the peruſal of it thou receive any profit, let God alone have the praiſe, and remember him in thy prayers, who is</p>

               <p>In this Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> doth prophetically fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn <hi>Timothy</hi> of, and practically forearm him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the Apoſtacy of the latter times.</p>
               <p>In it firſt, the <hi>Malady</hi> is deſcribed, and 2. The <hi>Remedy</hi> is preſcribed.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:172730:28"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Apoſtacy is deſcribed.</hi> 1. By the ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it; the <hi>Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly,</hi> had it been doubtful, it need not have been ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but its certain, and therefore calls for the more caution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſeaſon of it, <hi>In the latter times.</hi> When the world groweth old, it will dore and decline; when it comes to the bottom, it will run dregs. Its laſt days which ſhould be beſt, will be its worſt days</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the cauſes procuring it, <hi>Seducing ſpirits, and Doctrine of devils,</hi> Satan and his Emiſſaries will, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes carry firebrands abroad to ſet the world in a helliſh flame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Remedy is preſcribed,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Something he muſt forbear, <hi>Refuſe prophane and old wives fables;</hi>

Excommunica, alii.</note> If thou wouldſt not ſwim down with the tide of thoſe apoſtatiſing times, take heed of ſteering thy courſe by prophane though ancient cuſtoms: Refuſe them with ſcorn, reject them with anger; let thy ſpirit riſe and thy ſtomack turn at the very ſight of ſuch ſins. <hi>One way to prevent Apoſtacy, is to refuſe ungrounded antiquity.</hi> The will of the Father of ſpirits, not the ways of the fathers of our fleſh is to be the rule of our walking. It is well obſerved that God in no command but the ſecond (which forbids his Worſhip in any way not appointed by his Word) threatneth to viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children, becauſe ſuperſtitious. Worſhippers are of all men moſt ſtrengthned by the Traditions of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172730:28"/>their Fathers. They will tell us. <hi>Shall we be wiſer then our Fathers.</hi> Now becauſe they are reſolved to ſin with their Fathers, God is reſolved they ſhall ſuffer for their Fathers. They that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their forefathers in ſin, for ought I know muſt follow their forefathers to hell. If <hi>Timothy</hi> would not ſhare in others declenſions, he muſt forbear others traditions, <hi>Refuſe prophane and old wives fables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something he muſt alſo follow after, <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs:</hi> This is the ſpecial help which the skilful phyſician appointeth his beloved patient in thoſe infectious times to preſerve his ſoul in health. As a peſtiferous air is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the body, yet for a man to get, and make it his work to keep a ſound conſtitution will be an excellent means to prevent infection: So an Apoſtatizing place or people is very dangerous to the ſoul (ſpiritual diſeaſes are more catching and killing then corporal) but a ſpiritual habit of a real ſanctity, with a conſtant care to continue and increaſe it, will be a ſoveraign means to preſerve it in ſafety. Bodies without life quickly corrupt and become unſavory; not ſo living creatures: Running waters are ſweet and clean, when ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ponds putrifie and abound in vermine. He that is ever trading and thriving in godlineſs need not fear that he ſhall prove a bankrupt: <hi>Carts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow not going up hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> is conſiderable in his twofold capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As a Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> or in his particular
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172730:29"/>calling, in this reſpect he muſt exerciſe himſelf to godlineſs.

               <p>The Truth that I ſhall draw from the Text is this,

               <p>It is obſervable, that the more noble and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a being is, the more it is imployed in a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble working.

They do God the moſt ſervice, and they do him the beſt ſervice; they ſerve God without ſin, and they ſerve him without ceaſing; he <hi>makes his Angels ſpirits, and his Miniſters a flame of fire,</hi> Heb. 1.7. ſpirits are the moſt active crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with life, fire is the moſt active creature without life, a flame is the moſt operative part of the fire: Thus active are Angels in working for God.

               <p>Now as he hath given man a more excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the reſt of the viſible world, ſo hath he called him to follow after and abound in the moſt excellent work.

               <p>Inward worſhip is ſometimes ſet forth by loving God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. ſometimes by truſting him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.1. ſometimes by delighting in him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37.3. ſometimes by ſorrow for offending him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51.3. becauſe this Worſhip of God (as one peice of gold containeth many peices of ſilver) comprehendeth all of them. All the graces are but ſo many links of this golden chain. As all the members of the natural body are knit together, and walk always in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſo all the parts of the new man are joyned together, and never go but as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with their whole train; If there be one Wheel miſſing in a Watch, the end of the whole is ſpoiled; if one grace ſhould be wanting in a Saint, he would be unſainted. There is a concatenation of graces, as well as of moral vertues. Thoſe that Worſhip God give him their hotteſt love, their higheſt joy, their deepeſt ſorrow, their ſtrongeſt faith, and their greateſt fear, as <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he gives God all.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Moſes</hi> cals <hi>fearing God, Deut.</hi> 6.13. our <hi>Saviour</hi> quoting, calls <hi>Worſhipping God</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9, 10.) by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> becauſe the former is both a part and a ſign of the latter. As when the guard are watching at the Court gate, or on the ſtairs, and examining thoſe that go in, its a ſign the <hi>King
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:172730:34"/>is within,</hi> ſo when the fear of God ſtands at the door of the heart, to examine all that go in, leaſt the Traytor Sin ſhould ſteal in ſlily, its a ſign that <hi>God is within,</hi> that he ſits upon the Throne of the ſoul and is worſhipped there.</p>

               <p>To hold any thing in opinion, or to have any thing in affection for God which is not God, is Idolatry; to worſhip either men, as the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> did <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> (ſtiling him the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God) or the hoſt of Heaven, as the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> or the Devil, as the <hi>Indians;</hi> or the Belly, as the <hi>Glutton;</hi> or Riches, as the <hi>Covetous;</hi> or the Croſs, as the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is unholineſs.</p>
               <p>There is a civil worſhip due to men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.11. but ſacred worſhip is due onely to God; and he is a jealous God, who will not give his glory to ſtrangers, nor his praiſe to images.</p>

               <p>The Heathen worſhipped ſeveral gods, the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> worſhipped <hi>Belus;</hi> the <hi>Tyrians, Baal;</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, Diana;</hi> the <hi>Samians, Juno;</hi> the <hi>Lemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Vulcan;</hi> the <hi>Moabites, Chemoſh;</hi> the <hi>Syrians Rimmon;</hi> the E <hi>Kronites, Baalzebub;</hi> the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Bell;</hi> thoſe Infidels, as one obſerveth well had their <hi>Deos mortuos,</hi> Idols; <hi>mortales</hi> men; <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferos</hi> Luſts: therefore its conſiderable that when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Gentiles, during the time of their unregeneracy, whilſt they ſerved falſe gods, he ſaith, they lived <hi>without God, Eph.</hi> 2.12. Falſe gods are no Gods; an Idol is nothing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The extent, <hi>In heart and life:</hi> Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the worſhipping God in the <hi>inward motions</hi> of the heart, and the <hi>outward actions</hi> of the life; where the ſpring of the affections is clear, and the <hi>ſtream</hi> of the converſation runs clear, there is true godlineſs, the Egyptians of all fruits would make choice of the <hi>Peach</hi> to conſecrate to their goddeſs, and they gave this reaſon for it, becauſe the fruit thereof reſembleth an heart, and the leaf a tongue. As they gave heart and tongue to the falſe god, we muſt to the true God. Heart-godlineſs pleaſeth God beſt, but Life godlineſs honours him moſt; the conjunction of both make a compleat Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. In a godly mans heart, though ſome ſin be left, yet no ſin is liked; in his life, though ſin may remain, yet no ſin reigns: His heart is ſuitable to Gods Nature, and his life is anſwerable to Gods Law; and thence he is fitly denominated a <hi>Godly man.</hi>

               <p>The life of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> lyeth much more in the heart then in the life; and the Saints character is from their inward carriage towards God, <hi>they worſhip God in the Spirit, Phil.</hi> 3.3. A great French Peer is called <hi>le bon Chreſtien, the good Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe they ſay it is never rotten at the core; <hi>God is a Spirit, and he will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.24. <hi>In truth,</hi> that is ſcripturally, oppoſite to the inventions of mens heads: <hi>In Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is ſincerely, oppoſite to the diſſimulation of mens hearts. The deeper the belly of the Lute is the pleaſanter the ſound; the deeper our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip comes from the heart, the more delightful it is in Gods ears.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Life godlineſs,</hi> as it ſets God on the <hi>Throne of the conſcience,</hi> ſo it walks with God in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> Though the ſpiritual (as the natural) life begin at the heart, yet it doth not end there, but proceeds to the hands; the ſame water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Bucket which is in the Well. As when the heart is like a dunghil full of filth, it ſends forth a noiſom and unſavoury ſtench in the life; ſo when the heart is like a box of musk, it perfumes and

               <p>Fourthly, The Rule, <hi>according to his revealed will</hi> Every part of Divine Worſhip, muſt have a Divine Precept.

               </head>
               <p>I Proceed to the ſecond particular promiſed, is to ſhew what it is for a man to exerciſe himſelf to <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> It implyeth theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To give it the precedency in all our actions;</hi> that which a man maketh his buſineſs he will be ſure to minde, whatſoever he omits. A good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will ſerve his ſhop before his ſports, and will ſometimes offer an handſom &amp; warrantable kind of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172730:37"/>diſreſpect to his friends, that his calling may have his company; he will have ſome excuſe or other to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void diverſions, and force his way to his trade through all oppoſition, and all becauſe he makes it his buſineſs: He that makes Religion his buſineſs, carrieth himſelf towards his general, as this man doth towards his particular calling: In his whole life he walks with God, and is ſo mannerly and dutiful as to give God the upper hand all the way. He knoweth that his God muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, that his family muſt be ſerved, and that his calling muſt be followed (for Religion doth not nullifie, onely rectifie his carriage towards his earthly vocation) but each in their order, that which is firſt in regard of excellency, is firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his induſtry. He is not ſo unnatural as to ſerve his cattle before his children, nor ſo Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as to ſerve his body and the world before his ſoul and his Saviour. He is ſo ſenſible of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ingagements to the bleſſed God, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotteth ſome time every day for his religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he will be ſure to pay God home to the utmoſt of his ability whoſoever he compounds with or pays ſhort.</p>
               <p>As he ſaile along through the tempeſtuous ſea of this world towards his eternal Haven of reſt, he hath many temporal affairs in his company, but he is ſpecially careful that they keep their diſtance, and ſtrike ſail through the whole voyage. If his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-buſineſſes offer, like <hi>Hagar,</hi> to juſtle or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel for preheminence with their ſuperior, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> he will if poſſible chide them, into ſubjection
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:172730:37"/>and cauſe them to ſubmit; but rather caſt them out, then ſuffer them to uſurp Authority over their Miſtris.</p>
               <p>He that minds Religion by the by, will if other things intervene, put it back, and be glad of an excuſe to wave that company, to which he hath no love; nay he doth in the whole courſe of his life, prefer his Swine, as the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> before his ſoul; ſet the Servant on Horſe-back, and ſuffer the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to go on foot. His voice to Religion is like the <hi>Jews</hi> to the poor man in vile Rayment; <hi>ſtand thou there, or fit thou here under my foot-ſtool;</hi> and his words to the World, are like theirs to the man in goodly apparel, <hi>Come up hither, or ſit thou here in a good place,</hi> James 2.2, 3. He doth like <hi>Jacob,</hi> lay the right hand of his care and diligence upon <hi>the youngeſt Son, the body;</hi> and the left hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>firſt born of the ſoul;</hi> That which was <hi>Eſaus</hi> curſe is eſteemed by him as a bleſſing, <hi>that the Elder ſerves the Tounger;</hi> He is ſo unwiſe as to eſteem lying vanities before real mercies; often ſo unworthy, as to forget <hi>God,</hi> whoſoever he remembreth; and ſo uncivil at beſt, as to give God the Worlds leavings, and to let the Almighty Creator Dance attendance till he pleaſeth to be at leaſure. If he be in the midſt of his devotion, he makes an end upon the ſmalleſt occaſion,
<note place="margin">Plut.</note> and is like the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> who ran from the Altar when he was about his Office, to ſee a Fole new fallen from his beloved Mare.</p>
               <p>But every Saint like <hi>Solomon</hi> firſt builds an houſe for God, and then for himſelf. Whoever be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172730:38"/>or whatever be neglected, he will take care that God be worſhipped; <hi>Abrahams</hi> Steward, when ſent to provide a Wife for <hi>Iſaak,</hi> though meat were ſet before him, refuſed to eat till he had done his errand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.33. Godlineſs is the errand about which man is ſent into the World, now as faithful ſervants we muſt prefer our Meſſage before our meat, and ſerve our Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſelves.</p>
               <p>He that makes godlineſs his buſineſs, gives it the firſt of the day, and the firſt place all the day. He gives it the firſt of the day; Jeſus Chriſt was at prayer, <hi>a great while before day, Mark</hi> 1.35. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>roſe up early in the morning to offer Sacrifice.</hi> Gen. 22.1. So did <hi>Job</hi> 1. and 5. <hi>David</hi> cryeth out <hi>O God, my God, early will I ſeek thee,</hi> Pſa. 63.1. <hi>In the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and look up,</hi> Pſa. 5.3. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in the morning early offered to their God <hi>Dagon.</hi> The <hi>Perſian Magi</hi> Worſhipped the riſing Sun, with their early hymns, The Saint in the morning waits upon Heavens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. As ſoon as he awakes, he is with God, one of his firſt works when he riſeth, is to ask his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father Bleſſing. Like the Lark he is up early, ſinging ſweetly the praiſe of his Maker, and often with the Nightingale late up, at the ſame pleaſant tune.</p>
               <p>He finds the morning a greater friend to the <hi>Graces,</hi> then it can be to the <hi>Muſes.</hi> Naturaliſts tell us that the moſt orient pearles, are generated of <hi>the Morning dew.</hi> Sure I am, he hath ſweet communion with God in morning duties.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:172730:38"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Let me tell thee, if Religion be thine occupation, thy buſineſs, God will hear from thee in the morning, one of the firſt things after thou art up will be to fall down and worſhip him. Thy mind will be moſt free in the morning, and thine affections moſt lively (as thoſe ſtrong waters are fulleſt of ſpirits which are firſt drawn) and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou canſt not think but that God who is the beſt and chiefeſt good, hath moſt right to them, and is moſt worthy of them.</p>
               <p>As a godly man gives religion the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the day, ſo he gives it the precedency in the day; The <hi>Jews</hi> (ſome ſay) divide their day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>prayer, labour</hi> and <hi>repaſt,</hi> and they will not omit prayer, either for their meat or labour. Grace (as well as nature) teacheth a godly man not to neglect either his Family or body, but it teacheth him alſo to prefer his ſoul, and his God before them both. <hi>Seneca</hi> though an Heathen, could ſay, I am greater, and born to greater things then to be a drudge to, and the ſlave of my body. A Chriſtians Character, is that he is not carnal, or for his body, but ſpiritual, or for his ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. It was a great praiſe which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Valentinian, Never man was a better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Maſter, then</hi> Valentinians <hi>body was to his ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the godly mans duty, to make Heaven his Throne, and the Earth his foot-ſtool. Its the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which one gives upon thoſe words, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Earth, Gen.</hi> 1.28. that is thy body, and all earthly things to thy ſoul. Our earthly callings muſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172730:39"/>give way to our Heavenly, we muſt ſay to them as Chriſt to his Diſciples. <hi>Tarry you here while I go and pray yonder,</hi> and truely godlineſs muſt be firſt in our Prayers, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come,</hi> before, <hi>give us this day our daily bread;</hi> and firſt in all our practices <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, and all other things ſhall be added to you.</hi> Mat. 6.33.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to make Religion ones buſineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth <hi>to purſue it with induſtry, in our converſations.</hi> A man that makes his calling his buſineſs, is not lazy but laborious about it, what pains will he take? what ſtrength will he ſpend? how will he toil and moil at it early and late? The Tradeſman, the Husbandman, eat not the bread of Idleneſs, when they make their callings their buſineſs; if they be good Husbands, they are both provident to obſerve their ſeaſons, and diligent to improve them for their advantage, they do often even dip their food in their ſweat, and make it thereby the more ſweet. Their induſtry appears in working hard in their callings, and in improving all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the furtherance of their callings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus he that makes Religion his buſineſs, is induſtrious and laborious in the work of the Lord. The heart of his ground, the ſtrength of his inward man, is ſpent about the good corn of Religion, not about the weeds of earthly occaſions. He makes haſt to keep Gods Commandements, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the lingring lazy Snail is reckoned among unclean creatures, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.30. and he is hot
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172730:39"/>and lively in his devotion, knowing that a dull,

               <p n="2">2. The induſtry of a man about his calling, or whatſoever he makes his buſineſs, appeareth in his taking all advantages for the furtherance thereof. A Tradeſman that minds his employment, doth not onely in his Shop, but alſo abroad, and when he is from Home, drive forward his Trade. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when he is in his Shop, his eyes are moſt about him, to ſee what is wanting, that it may be ſupplied, to take care that all his cuſtomers may be ſatisfied, and to order things ſo, that by his buying and ſelling, his ſtock may be increaſed; but if he walk from home, he doth not wholly leave his Trade behinde him If he viſit his friends or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and there be any likelyhood of doing any good, you may obſerve him queſtioning the price of ſuch and ſuch commodities, enquiring at what Rates they are afforded in thoſe parts, and if they be cheap, poſſibly furniſhing himſelf from thence, if dear (it may be) putting off a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of his own. Becauſe he makes it his buſineſs, his mind runs much upon it, that wherever he is, he will be ſpeaking ſomewhat of it, (if occaſion be offered) whereby he comes now and then to meet with ſuch bargains as tend much
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172730:42"/>to his benefit; ſo the Chriſtian that makes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his buſineſs, is induſtrious to improve all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the furtherance of his general call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as his time (for he is Gods ſervant) ſo his trade goeth forward every hour; He is <hi>David</hi> like as a ſparrow upon the houſe top looking on this ſide and that ſide to ſee where he may pick up ſome ſpiritual food. He doth not onely in the Church and in his Cloſet, but alſo in all his converſes with men walk with his God. If God proſper him, as the ſhip mounts higher according to the increaſe of the Tide, ſo his heart is lifted up the nearer to God, as Gods hand is enlarged towards him. If God afflict him, as the nipping north wind purifies the air, ſo the beſom of affliction doth ſweep the duſt of ſin out of his heart. As his pulſe is ever beating, ſo his heavenly trade is ever going forward His viſits to his friends are out of conſcience as well as out of courteſie, &amp; his endeavor is either by ſome ſavoury Scripture expreſſion, or ſome ſober acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to advantage his company: He will watch for a fit ſeaſon to do his own and others ſouls ſervice, and catch at it as greedily, and improve it as diligently as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants did <hi>Ahabs</hi> words.</p>
               <p>If he be eating or drinking, the ſalt of grace is ever one diſh upon the table to ſeaſon all his diet: He will raiſe his heart from the daily bread, to the bread that came down from heaven; he eateth, is full, and bleſſeth the Lord: Before he begins he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God leave, while he feeds, he taſteth Gods love, and when he hath done he giveth God thanks.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:172730:42"/>
               <p>If he be buying or felling, he is very willing that God ſhould be a witneſs to all his bargains, for he prayeth to God as if men heard him, and he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with men as if God ſaw him; His ſhop as well as his Chappel, is holy ground.</p>
               <p>If he be amongſt his Relations, he is both deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diligent to further Religion. His endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is that thoſe that are nigh him in the fleſh may be nigh God in the ſpirit. He is careful that both by his precepts and pattern he may do ſomwhat for their profit. His houſe as well as his heart is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Ceſars</hi> Image was ſtampt on a penny, as well as on a greater piece, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.20. So godlineſs which is the Image of the King of Kings is imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not onely on his greater and weightier, but alſo upon his leſſer and meaner practices.</p>
               <p>Godlineſs is not his <hi>Phyſick</hi> which he onely now and then (as at <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall</hi>) makes uſe of, but his food, which he daily dealeth about; beſides his ſet times for his ſet meals of Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devotion, he hath many a good bait by the by, in the day time. <hi>Evening, Morning, and at Noon will I pray, and cry aloud,</hi> Pſa. 55.17. Oh how love I thy Law, it is my meditation, (not ſome part but) all the day. Whether the actions he be about be natural or civil, he makes them ſacred; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Company he be in be good or bad, he will mind his holy calling; whether he be riding or walking, whether he be at home or abroad, whether he be buying or ſelling, eating or drinking, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be doing, or whereſoever he be going,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172730:43"/>ſtill he hath an eye to further godlineſs,
<note place="margin">Anima eſt tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte</note> becauſe he makes that his buſineſs. What the Philoſopher ſaid of the ſoul in relation to the body, The ſoul is whole in the whole body, and whole in every part of it, is true of godlineſs, in reference to the life of a Chriſtian, godlineſs is whole in his whole converſation, and whole in every part of it. As the conſtitution of mans body is known by his pulſe, if it beat not at all he is dead, if it beat and keep a conſtant ſtroke, its a ſign the body is ſound: Godlineſs is the pulſe of the ſoul, if it beat not at all, the ſoul is void of ſpiritual life, if it beat equally and conſtantly, it ſpeaks the ſoul to be in an excellent plight.</p>
               <p>It was the practice of our Saviour (who left us a bleſſed pattern therein) to be always furthering godlineſs; when bread was mentioned to him, upon it, he diſwaded his Diſciples from the leaven of the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 16.5.6. When water was denyed him by the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman, he forgets his thirſt and ſeeks to draw her to the Well-ſpring of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. When people came to him for bodily cures, how conſtantly doth he mind the ſafety of their ſouls; <hi>Thou art made whole, go ſin no more,</hi> or <hi>thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> He went about doing good, in the day time working Miracles and Preaching, in the night time he often gave himſelf to meditation and prayer.</p>

               <p>We may ſay of this work of Chriſtianity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with all other works, what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, <hi>There is none like it;</hi> this is <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,</hi> this <hi>is God-work,</hi> this <hi>is eternity-work,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172730:50"/>therefore of greateſt weight, and requireth us all to make it our buſineſs: Such blows as theſe three are, one would think might force fire out of a flint.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Soul-work:</hi> As ſoul wo is the heavieſt wo, and ſoul-wants are the greateſt wants, ſo ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is the weighteſt work; the dangers of a ſoul are the deepeſt dangers, the loſs of the ſoul is the dreadfulleſt loſs, the neglect of the ſoul is the dolefulleſt neglect: The conſequence of the action is frequently ſpecified from the excellency of the perſon or ſubject concerned in it. The ſoul of man is a moſt excellent piece, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſpirituality and immortality of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as alſo in regard of that divine image im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on it, thoſe heavenly qualities with which it was at firſt endowed. Princes ſtamp not their image (except in caſes of neceſſity) on braſs, or tynn, or leather, but on gold and ſilver, the chiefeſt and moſt excellent mettals; therefore though thoſe affairs which concern the body are but of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſpect, yet thoſe that concern the ſoul are of unconceivable weight and regard. One ſoul is more worth then ten thouſand bodies, then ten thouſand worlds.</p>

                  <hi>The greateſt thing</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>in this world is Man, and the greateſt thing in man is his Soul.</hi> It is an abridgement of the inviſible world, as the body is of the viſible: The body though no mean work conſidered abſolutely, yet of ordinary worth conſidered comparatively to the ſoul. It is a mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall incloſing a rich treaſure; as a common mask

It was not as the body framed of the duſt, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathed by God himſelf; it was not the fruit of ſome praeexiſtent matter, but the immediate effect of Divine power: The ſoul is in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as well as in a natural ſenſe, the life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, eſpecially if you take <hi>vivere</hi> for <hi>valere, to live for to be luſty, and to be in health;</hi> for what the Sun is to the greater, that the Soul is to the leſſer World. When the ſun ſhineth comfortably how chearfully do all things look? how well do they thrive and proſper? the birds ſing merrily, the beaſts play wantonly, the trees and hearbs put forth their buds and fruits; the whole Creation enjoyeth a day of light and joy: But when the Sun departeth, what a night of horror followeth? how are all things wrapt up in the ſable mantle of darkneſs? nay let but the heat of its beams abate, how do all faces gather paleneſs? the creatures are buried, as it were in the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheet of Winters froſt and ſnow: ſo when the ſoul ſhineth pleaſantly on the body, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with its beams of holineſs, with its rays of grace, the body cannot but enjoy a Summer of health and ſtrength. Such a ſoul in ſuch a body, is like a pure wax candle in a chryſtal lanthorn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing with its ſent, directing by its light, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172730:52"/>comforting with its heat; but if the ſoul be weak, and full of <hi>ſpiritual wants,</hi> the body muſt needs <hi>wither.</hi> The ſoul is the ſhip in which the body ſails, if that be ſafe the body is ſafe, if that ſinks the body ſinks for ever.</p>
               <p>From all this it appeareth that <hi>Soul-work</hi> is a <hi>weighty work</hi> (not to be dallied or trifled with) b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The higher the perſon is with whom we converſe, the holier and more exact ſhould our carriage be. If we walk with our equals, we toy and trifle by the way, and poſſibly if occaſion be, wander from them; but if we wait upon a Prince, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about our own near concernments, we are ſerious and ſedulous, watching his words, and working with the greateſt diligence, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his pleaſure. A Lawyer will mind the Countrymans cauſe when he is at leiſure, when greater affairs will give him leave, and then (it may be) do it but coldly and careleſly: But if he have buſineſs committed to him by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, which concerns the prerogative, he will make other cauſes ſtay, crowd out of the Preſs to ſalute this, attend it with all his parts, and power, and ability, and induſtry, and never take his leave of it till it be finiſhed. I need not explain my meaning in this, it is obvious to every eye that godlineſs is the worſhipping the infinite and ever bleſſed God; ſurely his ſervice is neither to be delayd nor dallied with, it is not to be ſlighted or ſlubberd over, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that doth the Work of the Lord negligently.</hi>

               <p>When we deal with our equals, with them that ſtand upon the ſame level with us, we may deal as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172730:53"/>men, our affections may be like Scales that are evenly poized, in regard of indifferency, but when we have to do with a God (ſo great, that in compariſon of him, the vaſt Ocean, the broad Earth, and the higheſt Heavens are all leſs then nothing, and ſo glorious that the great lights of the World, though every Star were a Sun, yet in reſpect of him are perfect darkneſs) we muſt be like Angels, our affections ſhould be all in a flame in regard of fervency and activity.

               <p>THirdly, Godlineſs muſt be made our principal buſineſs, our main work, becauſe <hi>otherwiſe we ſhall loſe our reward.</hi> We ſay <hi>As good never a whit as never the better.</hi> Piety without much pains will redound to little or no profit: How fooliſh is that builder, who in ſetting up an houſe hath been at much coſt, and yet loſeth all becauſe he will be at no further charge: <hi>Many loſe what they have wrought,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. Their works, becauſe not their buſineſs, are not perfect, and ſo to ſmall purpoſe. <hi>The ſloathful roaſts not what he took in hunting, Prov.</hi> 12.27. He was at ſome labour to catch the Beaſt, but was loath to be at any more in dreſſing it, and ſo all was loſt; laboriouſneſs to godlineſs is as the ſoul to the body; which being ſeparated from it, godlineſs dyeth and quickly becomes unſavoury.</p>
               <p>The reward of Godlineſs is of infinite worth, the end of Holineſs (as of Hope) is the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul, the eternal and immediate enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Heaven.

                  <hi>without the greateſt difficultie;</hi> they that will enjoy large Diadems muſt run through many deaths, and dangers, and uſe much diligence. Nature her ſelf will not beſtow her precious treaſure without much unwearied labour. Duſt and Dirt lye common in Streets, but the gold and ſilver mines are buried in the bowels of the earth, and they muſt work hard and dig deep that will come at them. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtones may be had in every quarry, but pearls are ſecret in the bottom of the Sea, and they muſt dive low and hazard their lives that will (fetch up the Oyſters in which they breed, and) enjoy them.</p>
               <p>When did we ever find Nature ſo prodigal of her gifts, as to beſtow skill and excellency in any art or ſcience, without induſtry and diligence. Doth ſhe not force her ſtudents to beat their brains, to waſt their bodies, to break their ſleep, to burn up their ſtrength, before ſhe will permit them to pry into her ſecrets, to pick the lock of her curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cabinet, and gain any conſiderable knowledge of her Wealth and richneſs. And can we think the God of Nature will give men to know him, as they are known of him, will beſtow on them the unſpeakable gift, the pearl of price, the holy of holies, ſuch things as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither mans heart conceive, while they lie lazing on the bed of Idleneſs.</p>

Though he offereth wares which are of infinite worth, and ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long yet no man regardeth.</p>

               <p>But poſſibly you may ſay, that there are many that make Religion their buſineſs, onely they are ſo near me that (according to the rule of Opticks which requires a due diſtance between the faculty and the object) I cannot behold them; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in every Country, Pariſh, Family, All are Chriſtians and make the Worſhip of God their main work.</p>

Pretenders to her ſervice are indeed like the ſand of the ſea numerous but practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners or faithful ſervants are like the pearl of the ſea rare and precious; <hi>many court her, but few mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her;</hi> for indeed men generally deal with God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as the <hi>Germans</hi> with the <hi>Italians,</hi> or the <hi>Dutch</hi>

               <p>Wherefore I muſt intreat thee, Reader, to make godlineſs thy ſole deſign and delight, thy main occupation and recreation.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:172730:79"/>the year long doing ſomewhat at their callings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſting up their accounts, or gathering in their debts, or amending ſomething in their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are amiſs; and therefore have no time for idleneſs, yet at ſome times of the year they are full of trading, their ſhops are crowded with cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, they are all the week either ſending out or taking in wares; now this time calls for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diligence and watchfulneſs.</p>
               <p>The time of ſacred duty is a Chriſtians market day, wherein he is much imployd, and therefore it calls for his greateſt diligence. He that leaves his Shop, or loyters in it at ſuch a time, muſt expect that his Shop will quickly leave him. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath his ſeaſons to Plow and Sow in, which if he be heedleſs and careleſs about, that either his ſeed be ſmutty, or his ſervant ſlothful, he can look for but a mean and poor harveſt. The hours of praying, and reading, and hearing, are the Saints opportunities and ſeaſons of grace; if he be not then careful and conſciencious to <hi>Plow up the fallow ground of his heart, and to ſow to the Spirit;</hi> his return will be very inconſiderable, he will Reap but a thin crop. But truely friend if thou haſt no reſpect to thy ſouls good, God hath to his own glory, and though he ſtoop to thee, ingiving thee leave to ſeek his face, and hear his voice, yet he will not be ſlighted by thee. He is a glorious and jealous Majeſty, and eſteemeth it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, for any to wait upon him without their beſt attire; Though <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> be dead, yet he ſpeaketh to thee to take heed how thou toucheſt the Ark.</p>

               <p>A Prince may be pleaſed, if his Kitchin be but indifferent neat and handſom, but he looks that in his <hi>Parlour</hi> (where he gives entertainment to his friend) all things ſhould be in <hi>Print.</hi> Where Gods ſpecial walk is amongſt his <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> and amidſt his <hi>Myrtle Trees,</hi> there Godlineſs muſt be our ſpecial work, <hi>Holineſs becometh thy houſe, O Lord for ever.</hi> Pſa. 93. <hi>ult.</hi> Godlineſs doth always ſute the back of a Saint: This gracious garment is a glorious ornament to him, whatever he is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or where ever he is going; but the apparel doth become him beſt in his approaches to the holy God. No Hangings, no Tapeſtry becomes Gods houſe ſo well as <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and no place is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as the Houſe of God for this coſtly, comely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>
               <p>God is more honored or diſhonoured in our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions,</hi> then in all the actions of our lives; in them we do directly and immediately pretend his Honor and Service, and therefore if we do not walk in them watchfully, and intend them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly the greater is our ſin. For a treſpaſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt holy things, the Jews were to bring a Ram to be valued by the ſhekel of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; for a treſpaſs againſt their brethren, a Ram was required, but no ſuch valuation expreſſed; whence <hi>Origen</hi> infers, <hi>Aliud eſt peccare in ſanctis, aliud extra ſancta:</hi> It is one thing to ſin in holy things, another thing to ſin beſide them, and he urgeth that place in <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If a man ſin againſt another man the Judge ſhall judge him, but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat

               <p>The waters of the Sanctuary, are like the waters given to a ſuſpected Wife, if ſhe were innocent, it witneſt her honeſty, made her fruitful if barren, and did her good; but if ſhe were guilty ſweld her belly, rotted her bowels, and did her hurt.

Parents ſet their Children before them at Church, and have their eyes much upon them, becauſe otherwiſe they will be toying and playing; truly ſo will thy heart, if thine eye be not on it. Alaſs thy heart in duty is like one that looks through an Optick Glaſs on ſome ſmall object, with a Palſie hand, its long before he can diſcern it, and as ſoon as he hath found it, ſo unſteady is his hand that he hath loſt it again; therefore it behoves thee to keep it diligently, and to watch it narrowly: There is a bottomleſs depth of deceit in thine heart, how unwillling is it to a duty? how much wandring in a duty? how ſoon weary of a duty? <hi>The heart is

Secondly, there is the degree of its deceit, and indeed it is beyond all degrees. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things;</hi> No creature ſo ſly and ſubtle as mans heart; Nothing in this World can equal it for tricks and wiles; Nay as this deceit of mans heart is ſo great that none can match it, ſo alſo it is ſo deep that none can find it, none can fadom it, <hi>Who can know it?</hi> The largeſt, the longeſt line of mans underſtanding, can never ſearch to the bottom of this Sea. Thirdly, Here is <hi>the danger of it, The heart of man is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> It is not deceitful in ſuch a degree, ſo much through weakneſs as through wilfulneſs, it is deſperately carried towards deadly courſes. It devotes it ſelf wholly to deceive and deſtroy. How many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:172730:83"/>will it have to make thee to omit holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances? if thou overcome them how ſubtle will it be to make thee heedleſs and heart-leſs in the ſervice of God? It will fill thee with cares and thoughts of the World, purpoſely to choak the good ſeed of the Word; if at any time thou wind it up to any ſeriouſneſs in an ordinance, how quickly, and how ſwiftly like a Clock or a Jack, doth it run down. Surely Reader, the Maſter that hath ſuch a cozening Servant, muſt look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to him, if he would not be cheated by him. If thou doſt not watch at the Altar, the Birds will devour the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were before the Throne day and night, were full of eyes behind and before and within, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6, and 8. Extraordinary heed is neceſſary when we come into Gods Houſe. We had need to have our eys about us, when we come to deal immediately with him who is of purer eys, then to behold iniquity. The <hi>Athenians</hi> in time of their Sacrifice, had a Monitor to bid them be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, calling on them, <hi>Hoc agite, mind the work ye are about, Plut.

When the word paſſeth through both ears, as waters through a leaking Veſſel, no wonder if it be unprofitable. Leaſt it ſhould do ſo, let us give the more diligent heed ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. If men be told of the dreadful end of ſin, and the great danger of their precious ſouls, and they mind it not, will they ever ſtrive to prevent it?

               <p>In prayer alſo be heedful, <hi>watch unto prayer,</hi> Mark 13.33. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when building, did work and watch, watch and work, becauſe of his Enemies; when thou art at prayer, temptations without will be waiting, corruptions within will be working; and therefore its requiſite for thee to be watching.</p>

He is terrible not onely in the <hi>high places of the field,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>holy places of the faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How canſt thou expect that God ſhould heed thy prayers, when thou doſt not heed them thy ſelf; Wouldſt thou give Almes to a Beggar that by his carriage and language ſhould ſlight both thee and thy bounty? If a condemned malefactor were ſuing to a Prince for his life, and in the midſt of his intreaties ſhould ſee a Moth or a Fly, and leave his ſuit and follow after that; would this wretch deſerve a pardon. And is it not as unreaſonable that God ſhould grant thy requeſts, if thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow thoſe fooliſh objects which thy heart or the Devil offer to thee in the midſt of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; monſtrous compoſitions, wherein is the face and voice of a man, the heart and feet of a beaſt, muſt needs be odious to God; O bind thine heart to its good behaviour, when thou goeſt into Gods Houſe. Men put Locks and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on Wild Horſes, whom no incloſure can keep in. This watching the heart in duties, will faſten and tye it, as with cords to the Altar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Act grace in duties,</hi> the acting of grace in a duty, is the grace of a duty. The Chriſtian muſt attend on the means of grace,

If the matter of thy performance be according to the word, and thou wilfully fail in the manner, thou wilt inſtead of a bleſſing, meet with a blow. God had Sacrifices from the Jews of his own appointment for the matter, and yet they were unſavoury to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. It is the manner which makes or mars every action, that is the form which ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates all our devotion; grace is Gods own Image, abundantly amiable in his eye, and that muſt be Stampt on all our Coyn of duties, or they will never be currant with Heaven. Kings ſuffer no Coyn to go in their Dominions, but what hath their own ſtamp. <hi>Tamberlane</hi> would not own a pot of gold which his Souldier found and brought him, becauſe it wanted his Fathers impreſſion.

               <p>Indeed the Chriſtian hath no natural power for theſe ſpiritual performances, but God gives him his Spirit for this purpoſe, that he might be enabled to do ſacred duties, with ſutable graces; <hi>we know not how to pray as we ought, but the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi>

               <p>It was a ſacred Law among the <hi>Moloſſians,</hi> that whoſoever came to the King with his ſon in his arms ſhould be pardoned whatſoever offence he

God and man are enemies, there is no appearing before this dreadful King without his Son in our arms, and with him there is no fear of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe; <hi>In him we have boldneſs and acceſs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence by the faith of him,</hi> Epheſ. 3.12. As God and man are angry, Chriſt is <hi>medium reconciliatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> he makes them friends; as God and man are reconciled, Chriſt is <hi>medium communionis,</hi> he is the means of their fruition of each other. Therefore Reader whatever thou doſt, whether thou prayeſt, or heareſt, or ſingeſt, or readeſt, <hi>do all in the name of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.17. Conſider thy admiſſion into Gods preſence is by Chriſt: <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by the Son,</hi> Joh. 14.6. <hi>Through him we have acceſs unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. It is his blood which hath purchaſed thee this gracious priviledge. He alone hath turned the <hi>ſeat of Juſtice into a Throne of Grace.</hi> When thou approacheſt God, he would be a fire to conſume thee, not a Father to imbrace thee, were it not for his Son. Conſider alſo thy aſſiſtance in duties is from Chriſt; <hi>Without him thou canſt do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.3. O how dull and dead is thy heart in the moſt ſolemn duty, unleſs this Lord of life quicken it. Though thou haſt a real princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſpiritual life, yet unleſs Chriſt draw thee, give the quickning and enciting Grace thou canſt not run after him in a duty.</p>
               <p>Further, Thine acceptance in the Ordinances
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172730:89"/>of God is through Chriſt. O how unſavoury would thy beſt duties be were it not for the odors of his moſt ſweet ſacrifice. The golden Cenſor and the Incenſe under the Law typified that all our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances muſt be perfumed and preſented by Chriſt, before they can be accepted with God. The ſmoke of the Incenſe muſt aſcend with the Saints prayers before they can be pleaſing. The incenſe (which ſignified the merits of Chriſt) is the pillar of ſmoak in which the beleevers performances mount up to Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4. No wonder that <hi>David</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo hard <hi>Let my prayers come before thee like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</hi> The Prieſts when they went into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to ſacrifice were commanded to put off their own, and to put on the holy garments provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.43. intimating, that none muſt approach God in the rags of their own, but in the robes of Chriſts Righteouſneſs. The Ark which was a ſpecial type of Chriſt (without of Shittim wood, ſpeaking his Humanity, within of wrought gold, typifying his Deity) did ſignifie thus much to us; it covered the two Tables, ſo Chriſt the Law; there God gave his gracious anſwers, and was propitious to his people, ſo God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perſons and prayers of men in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. If the Patriachs were welcome to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> it was for <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſake; and if the people of God are welcome at any time to him, it is for Jeſus ſake.</p>
               <p>Faith in Chriſt is the eye which raviſheth the heart of God; <hi>Thou haſt ſtoln away mine heart with one of thine eyes,</hi> Cant. 4. Of all the Virgin-Graces

Therefore Reader when thou goeſt to God be ſure to take Chriſt along with thee, as ever thou wouldſt ſpeed. Let thy prayers and petitions be in his name with an eye to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14.13.

               <p>Thirdly, If thou wouldſt make Religion thy bufineſs in holy duties, <hi>Perform them to give God glory by them, and to receive grace through them:</hi> Ordinances muſt be uſed both as a teſtimony of our ſubjection to God, and as the way of communion with God.

               <p>Reader, remember thine errand at ordinances is to get grace, thou haſt Gods promiſe to them, and his power and faithfulneſs, both ingaged for its performance, and its thy fault and folly if thou goeſt hungry from a full table, and empty from a free and large treaſure.

In this duty the children of God whiſper him in the ear, open their minds, and unboſom themſelves to him, as his intimate friends and favourites. He hath been pleaſed to command it, not onely out of his Dominion over them, and for his own glory <hi>(He that offereth praiſe glorifieth me)</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo out of his compaſſion to them, and for their good, that by prayers (as men far diſtant do by letters) there might be a conſtant and uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted intercourſe and correſpondence betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</p>
               <p>Men by diſcourſing together come to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at firſt, and continue their acquaintance by ſending to and hearing from one another. Prayer which is the ſpeech of man with his Maker, is a ſpecial means whereby he comes to be acquainted with God, as alſo to increaſe and continue this acquaintance. Prayer indeed bringeth Heaven down to man, and prayer carrieth man up to heaven; It is the chief duty wherein all the graces meet, they ſhine brightly like ſo many glorious Stars in this Firmament.</p>
               <p>Of all graces, faith obtaineth the crown, <hi>above all take the ſhield of faith;</hi> Other jewels are of great value, but this is the faireſt <hi>ſparkling Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond.</hi> Among all duties prayer ſeems to challenge
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:172730:95"/>the garland of honour, <hi>Concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</hi> This is the Favourite in the Heavenly Court, to whom the King of Kings can deny nothing. This duty is of ſuch weight that it is frequently put for Gods whole worſhip, <hi>Seek ye the Lord ſeek his ſtrength, ſeek his face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Pſa. 105.4, 5. Gods Temple which was the beauty of holineſs, the habitation of the moſt high, was baptized by God himſelf with this name, <hi>My Houſe ſhall be called of all Nations an houſe of prayer, Iſa.</hi> 56.7.

Pearles of a very high price, are never ſet but in gold, the choiceſt mettal. The Worſhip and people of God are more worth then all this World, but O how much is God worth! yet all theſe gliſter gloriouſly in the ring of prayer.</p>
               <p>There is no duty in my obſervation which hath ſo many precepts for it, or promiſes to it, as prayer, and ſure I am, there is no duty which giveth more honour to God, or receiveth more honour from God then prayer.</p>
               <p>Prayer hath a twofold preheminence above all other duties whatſoever. In regard of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of its influence, and opportunity for its performance. The univerſality of its influence.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:172730:95"/>As every ſacrifice was to be ſeaſoned with Salt, ſo every undertaking, and every affliction of the creature muſt be ſanctified with prayer; nay as it ſheweth the excellency of gold, that its laid upon ſilver it ſelf, ſo it ſpeaketh the excellency of prayer, that not onely natural and civil, but even Religious and ſpiritual actions are overlaid with prayer. We pray not onely before we eat or drink our bodily nouriſhment, but alſo before we feed on the bread of the Word, and the bread in the Sacrament; prayer is requiſite to make every providence, and every ordinance bleſſed to us; Prayer is needful to make our particular callings ſuccesful, prayer is the guard to ſecure the fort royal of the heart, prayer is the Porter to keep the door of the lips, prayer is the ſtrong Hilt which defendeth the hands, prayer perfumes every rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prayer helps us to profit by every condition, prayer is the Chymiſt that turnes all into Gold, prayer is the Maſter workman, if that be out of the way, the whole Trade ſtands ſtill, or goeth backward. What the Key is to the Watch, that prayer is to Religion, it winds it up and ſets it a going. It is before other duties in regard of opportunity for its performance. A Chriſtian cannot always hear, or always read, or always communicate, but he may pray continually. No place, no co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:172730:96"/>ſeeth him; if he be waiting at table with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he may pray when no ear heareth him. If he be in the mountains with our Saviour, he may pray; If he be in the priſon with <hi>Paul,</hi> he may pray; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is, prayer will help him to find God out: Every Saint is Gods Temple; <hi>And he that carrieth his Iemple about him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, may go to prayer when he pleaſeth.</hi> Indeed to a Chriſtian every houſe is an houſe of prayer, every cloſet a chamber of preſence, and every place he comes to, an Altar whereon he may offer the ſacrifice of prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer is an humble lifting up the heart, or pouring out the ſoul to God in the name of Chriſt:</hi> It is a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abba Father.</hi> As Scripture is Gods Letter wherein he openeth his mind to man, ſo Prayer is mans Letter wherein he openeth his mind to God.

               <p n="3">3. To the <hi>Conſequents,</hi> or thoſe things which muſt follow after prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Antecedents</hi> of prayer. Preparation is neceſſary before prayer. <hi>Zopher</hi> acquainteth <hi>Job</hi> how his prayers might come to be prevalent. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hand unto him,</hi> Job 11.13.

               <p>God commandeth us both to look to our hearts and mouths when we are in his houſe; <hi>be not raſh with thy mouth to utter any thing before God, and keep thy feet when thou art in the Houſe of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1, 2.

When the Chriſtian, like <hi>Daniel,</hi> hath firſt opened the windows of his ſoul by contemplation, then he may kneel down to prayer.</p>
               <p>Prayer is a building which reacheth up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, meditation layeth in all the coſtly materials which are requiſite for this building. He that would make any riddance of his work, muſt take care that all his materials be brought in before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; if they be to fetch when he comes to work, he will make long and tedious Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work indeed.</p>
               <p>Something thou art to meditate on, relating to thy ſelf, ſomthing relating to God.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which relate to thy ſelf, are thy <hi>ſins, wants and mercies;</hi> There are three parts of prayer (though I know ſome reckon the firſt rather an adjunct) <hi>Confeſſion, Petition,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving:</hi> Now meditation gives each of theſe the work which they are to do, like a faithful Steward it gives every one their proper and peculiar portion.

And for Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he did not write them in the Sand, but he treaſured them up in his memory. <hi>Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is before mine eyes, Pſa.</hi> 26.3. And though ſome of them were ſtale (ancient mercies) yet they were not ſowre to <hi>Davids</hi> taſte, he did not throw them away as Old Almanacks out of date, <hi>I will remember the days of old, the years of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, Pſa.</hi> 77. Rather then God ſhould not be paid his thanks, for favours to his Fore-fathers, <hi>David</hi> would take the Debts from their ſcore, and ſet them upon his own File.</p>
               <p>Confeſſion of ſin muſt be with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; petition for mercy muſt be with faith and fervency; Thanksgiving muſt be with admiration of God, and delight in God; Now it is medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſins, wants and miſeries, which provides fuel for the fire of theſe graces to work upon, and which they break out into an Heavenly flame.</p>
               <p>Meditate on thy ſins; Thy duty in prayer is to Indict, Arraign, and Condemn, and Execute thoſe Malefactors and Tranſgreſſors of the Royal Law, which can never be done till they are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If thou wilt kill thoſe Foxes that ſpoil the

Make paſt mercies, by meditation preſent with thee. How many years haſt thou lived, and every moment of thy life haſt breathed in mercy? Do not forget former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours beſtowed on thee or thine. The Civet box when the Civet is gone ſtill retains it ſcent; the veſſel when the liquor is gone hath ſtill a ſavour of it: So when thy mercies are paſt and ſpent, thou ſhouldeſt ſtill have the ſcent and ſavour of them in thy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Meditate upon the number of thy preſent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, perſonal, domeſtical, national, temporal, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: How many are the mercies which thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt in bed, at board, at home, abroad? Thy houſe, thy barns, thy children, thy body, thy ſoul, are all full of bleſſings; thou haſt many poſitive, many privative mercies. <hi>Many, O Lord, my God are thy wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts to us ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: If I would declare and ſpeak them, they are more then can be numbered, Pſal.</hi> 40.4. Think of them particularly; meat ſwallowed down whole doth not yield ſuch nouriſhment as when it is cut into ſmall pieces. If jewels are bundled up together, their riches and worth are hid, they muſt be viewed and conſidered one by one, then their value will appear.</p>
               <p>Meditate on the nature of them how freely they are beſtowed: When thou waſt Gods enemy he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172730:103"/>fed thee, and cloathed thee, and maintained thee; as when a man turneth his back upon the Sun, the Sun even then refreſheth him with his beams; ſo when thou didſt depart away from God, he even then followed thee with goodneſs; like the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he giveth his pleaſant ſtreams to thee <hi>gratis.</hi> For alas thou art leſs then the leaſt of all Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, worſe then any loathſome Toad, or poiſonous Serpent: This will be an excellent file to ſet off the mercies of God in their lively, lovely colours: that <hi>David</hi> ſo great a King ſhould do ſo much for ſuch a dead Dog as <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> did exceedingly affect his heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. So do thou think with thy ſelf, What am I, and what is my Fathers houſe, that the Lord ſhould do ſo much for me.</p>
               <p>Meditate upon the fulneſs and greatneſs of thy mercies: What diſtinguiſhing mercies are thy Body-mercies? they are more then God oweth thee, and more then he beſtoweth upon others. Alas, many want health, liberty, food, rayment, ſleep, limbs, ſenſes, reaſon, and poſſibly thou enjoyeſt them all. But Oh! of what concernment are thy Soul-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the image of God, the blood of Chriſt, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, the Goſpel of thy Salvation, Sabbaths, Sacraments, and ſeaſons of grace: God hath not dealt ſo with every people, as with this Nation; nor with every perſon, as with thee: Thou art, as the Pſalmiſt phraſeth it, laden with benefits, haſt ſuch a weight, ſuch a burthen of benefits upon thy back, that thou canſt hardly ſtir or ſtand under them. Haſt thou not bleſſings of the womb, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the field, bleſſings of the Throne, bleſſings
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172730:103"/>of the foot-ſtool, bleſſings in thy going out, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in thy coming in, which way canſt thou look and not ſee bleſſings? where canſt thou tread and not ſtand on bleſſings? thy whole life is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a bundle of bleſſings; theſe thoughts before prayer may ſtir thee up to bleſs the giver. If thou ſhouldſt bleſs men when they curſe thee, much more ſhouldſt thou bleſs God, when he bleſſeth thee.</p>
               <p>Meditate on the God to whom thou art to pray, Conſider his <hi>Majeſty and greatneſs, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> calls him, <hi>The great and terrible God,</hi> Nehem. 1.5. He is ſo great, the Heavens and heavens of heavens cannot contain him, that the Earth, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Ocean, are in compariſon of him as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yea, leſs then nothing, and vanity. Think of his attributes and infinite excellencies. <hi>God is in Heaven and thou art on Earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2. As God riſeth in our thoughts ſelf falleth. That Sun diſcovereth all our duſt. O how are we aſhamed of our drops, when we ſtand by this Ocean. This ſerious apprehenſion of thy diſtance will quicken thee to reverence. Gods greatneſs and mans vileneſs, are both arguments to make man humble and wary in the Worſhip of God. Couldſt thou behold God in Heaven, in what Majeſty he there appeareth on his Throne of glory, how his heavenly Courtiers vail their faces in his preſence, lay their Crowns at his feet, and ſerve him, though joyfully, yet humbly and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with what reverence and holy fear, wouldſt thou go to prayer?</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:172730:104"/>
               <p>Meditate on his <hi>mercy and goodneſs,</hi> what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he hath made to prayer, how bountiful he is to his ſuppliants. He doth more then they can ask or think, he gives liberally without upbraiding. It was ſaid of <hi>Severus the Emperor,</hi> that he was more troubled that men asked nothing, then that he gave much. God delighteth both to be ſought and found. This is neceſſary to ſtrengthen the faith. <hi>He that commeth to God, muſt beleive that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. He that would pray and obtain a bleſſing, muſt beleive Gods being, <hi>that he is,</hi> and Gods bounty, <hi>that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Meditate on his rich bounty, <hi>Abraham</hi> asked but one Son, God gives him ſeed like the Stars in the Heavens for multitude; the Debtor deſires but forbearance, and he freely forgives the whole Debt. The ſhekel of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary is double to the ordinary ſhekel.</p>
               <p>God delighteth to ſee men <hi>joyful</hi> in his houſe <hi>of prayer,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. to ſee their countenances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his chear: now meditation of his Royal bounty, how he giveth like a King, like a God, will help thee to this hearty chearfulneſs. Beleive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou prayeſt, that thy hand of prayer ſhall not knock at Heavens gate in vain, that God will not ſend thee away ſad. It is reported of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Flavius,</hi> that he ſhould ſay, I am ſorry that any man ſhould preſent a petition to me as if he were offering meat to an Elephant, with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand. Conſider not onely his habitation, <hi>which art in Heaven,</hi> but alſo his relation to thee, <hi>Our
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172730:104"/>Father;</hi> before thou calleſt he will anſwer, and when thou ſpeakeſt he will ſay, here am I, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. Thus when thou haſt by meditation cut the Sacrifice in peices, put the wood in order, and laid all upon the Altar, thou mayſt by prayer put fire to them, and offer up a Sacrifice to God of a <hi>ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As Meditation, <hi>ſo the ſtirring up of thy graces</hi> is needful to further this duty. Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will do much towards it (as thou haſt heard) I ſhall therefore ſpeak the leſs to it. Every perſon that hath grace doth not always pour out his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers rightly. Graces muſt be exerciſed in our duties. Grace may lie as fire under aſhes upon the hearth of thy heart, and be ſo far from flaming, that it may not ſo much as glow, and how then canſt thou expect any warmth from it, thy duty is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſtir up the coales, and endeavour that the fire may blaze out. It is the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> communication ſeaſoned with grace, which onely is ſavoury to God. <hi>Cato</hi> being asked why he was ſo diligent to learn the Greek language in his old age, anſwered, <hi>I hear, the Gods ſpeak Greek, and I would willingly ſpeak to them in their own language,</hi> All the words of God are gracious, Its ſaid of his Son, <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips</hi> Pſa. 45.2. Thoſe therefore that would not ſpeak to God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known language, a tongue wich he underſtandeth not, muſt accent all their expreſſions to him with grace. It is the ſmell of the ſpice of grace in the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> not of Garlick and Onions in the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which is ſo pleaſant and fragrant to God,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:172730:105"/>
                  <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſs like Pillars of ſmoke, perfumed with Myrrhe and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, with all powders of the Merchant?</hi> Cant. 3.6. Some take the words to be the voice of the Angels, thoſe friends of the Bride groom, admiring the Churches gracious expreſſions and continual aſſentions of her ſoul, in her prayers to God, others take them to be the words of Chriſt, being raviſhed with the odoriferous ſmell of thoſe graces which his Spouſe acted in her Sacrifices he ſtood amazed at the beauty of her perſon, and the ſweetneſs of her breath, the graciouſneſs of her petitions: <hi>What lovely Lady, what woman is here?</hi> (ſo the Hebrew) <hi>What peerleſs Paragon is this, which ſendeth up ſuch Spiritual Sacrifices, ſuch ſweet Incenſe, kindled by the fire of Gods own Spirit; laid upon a meritorious Altar, aſcending and fuming up like the rowllings and agglomerations of ſmoak to the Lord himſelf, and more welcome and grateful then all the coſtly evaporations of myrrhe and frankincenſe, and all powders of the Merchants.</hi> The Angel which aſcended to heaven in the flame of the Altar, is ſaid to do <hi>wonderouſly,</hi> Judg. 13.19, 20. It was wonderful both to Chriſt and his friends, to behold the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his Spouſes gracious performance, how it aſcended to Heaven, <hi>elationibus fumi,</hi> like pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ſmoak, and came up for <hi>a memorial before God.</hi> The deſire of nature in prayer, is like ſparks which fly out of the tunnel of the chimney, and then vaniſh; but the deſire of grace in prayer, is like pillars of ſmoak, which mounteth up to the higheſt Heavens.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:172730:105"/>
               <p>When <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons went down to <hi>Egypt</hi> to fetch corn, they carried ſome along with them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them by the way; when the Chriſtian goeth to Chriſt by prayer for more ſpiritual food, he muſt carry ſome along with him to ſtrengthen him in the duty: A little water poured into the pomp, will fetch up much: a little grace acted in a duty, may help thee to much more. As the ſhip is ſometimes wind-bound, that it cannot move towards its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo without the exerciſe of grace, the ſoul is wind-bound, there is no ſtirring towards Heaven. A graceleſs man in prayer (as was ſaid of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>) may talk <hi>much,</hi> but ſpeaketh <hi>little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things which will hinder the duty muſt be refuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All ſin</hi> in general, ſin regarded in the ſoul, makes prayers diſregarded of God, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer,</hi> Pſa. 66.18: He that expecteth pardon, muſt throw down his Weapons of Rebellion. The Child that asketh forgiveneſs of his Oaths, muſt not deſire it of his Father with Curſes in his mouth? When duſt clogs the Wheel of the Watch or Clock, they cannot ſtrike true; when ſin hampereth and clogs the Wheels of the affections, the mouth will never ſpeak true or right in its Petitions. <hi>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be an abomination,</hi> Pro. 28.9. It is high impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, for him that will not hear God, to look that God ſhould hear him.</p>
               <p>When the ſin of the petitioner is before Gods eyes, his petitions cannot enter into Gods ears.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:172730:106"/>The wide mouth of ſin out-cryeth the voice of his prayers; as the Fiſh called the <hi>Remora,</hi> though it be but little, will ſtop a great Ship in its full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, truely ſo the ſinalleſt ſin loved and liked will hinder the courſe of prayer, though it be never ſo inſtant and vehement. The Lords ear is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy that it cannot hear, but your iniquities ſeparate between you and your God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. Men by falls ſomtimes loſe their ſpeeches, men by fin loſe their prayers.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Ninivites</hi> prayed and turned from their evil ways, then God granted their requeſts, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> cryed to God but in vain (he bid them go to the Gods whom they had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) till they put away the ſtrange Gods from among them, <hi>then his ſoul was greived for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Iſrael,</hi> Judges 10.10, to 17. Reformation is a good uſher to go before ſupplication. When the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> prepared War againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> the Biſhop hearing of it, falls to praying and reforming, ſaying, <hi>At ego curabo eccleſiam meam &amp; Deus pugnabit pro me, I will take care to reforme my Church, and God will take care to fight for me.</hi> When the Duke heard this, he Disbanded his forces with this ſpeech, <hi>I am too weak for him that caningage God on his ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be ſure Reader to put away iniquity far from thee, when thou art drawing neer to the throne of grace, <hi>then ſhalt thou make thy prayer unto God, and he ſhall hear,</hi> Job 22.23, 27. Prayer is (as it were) a plaiſter to heal a man that is wounded. Now as a plaiſter to one peirced with an Arrow or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:172730:106"/>will do no good, till the Dart or Bullet be taken out of the body, ſo prayer will not be healing and prevalent till ſin (in regard of love and delight) be taken out of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>As all ſin in general moſt be laid by, ſo <hi>Worldly thoughts and wrath in particular. Wrath;</hi> Anger like Leven ſowreth the acrifice; <hi>I will that men lift up holy hands without wrath,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. He that beggeth peace at Gods hands, muſt not do it with <hi>war</hi> in his own heart.

                  <hi>Hierom</hi> confeſſed of himſelf that when he had been angry, he durſt not enter into the Church, but <hi>totum animo &amp; corpore contremuiſſe,</hi> he did trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble very much both in body and mind: Chriſtians muſt be ſingular as in their principles, ſo in their practices; It is more comfortable to love a friend, but this an Heathen may do, it is more honourable to love an Enemy, and this every Chriſtian muſt do.</p>
               <p>There are two things in forgiving thoſe that wrong us. Firſt, An inward <hi>remiſſion of the fault,</hi> ſo much as it concerneth us, or a removal of wrath and revengeful deſires towards the perſon wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us; and this if we do not, we loſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. A ſtormy troubled Sea, caſteth up mire and dirt, ſo when there is a ſtorm of paſſions in the ſoul, the heart foameth up its own ſhame in prayer, it bubleth up a great deal of filth. Secondly, In
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:172730:107"/>forgiveneſs there is an <hi>outward profeſſion of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward remiſſion,</hi> and this muſt be done when the party acknowledgeth his fault. If the offender ſay, <hi>I repent;</hi> the offended maſt ſay, <hi>I remit:</hi> Surely did men but conſider the infinite wrongs they do, and affronts which they offer to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God every day, and yet how they expect to be pardoned, they would, when abuſed ſay, as <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> (to one that begged pardon for a friend of his, who had uſed ill ſpeeches againſt his Majeſty) <hi>Let him for whom thou art a Suitor learn to ſpeak little, and I will learn to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don much.</hi> The Spouſe of Chriſt is compared to a Dove, which (ſome ſay) is <hi>ſine-felle,</hi> without Gall; The very Heathen when they offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, threw the Gall of the Beaſt away; and Reader, wouldſt thou offer to God the Gall of malice, revenge wrath and bitterneſs with the Sacrifice of thy prayers? Remember where the Gall is broke the fleſh taſteth bitter, and when the ſtrings jar, the Inſtrument will make but harſh Muſick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worldly thoughts</hi> muſt alſo be laid by. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our when he taught us to pray, by the preface to the Petitions telleth us where our affections in prayer ſhould be; <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> Our hearts in prayer muſt be in Heaven, the eys of our minds muſt look up thither, as well as the eyes of our bodies. The Mahometans in <hi>India</hi> when they begin their devotion ſtop their ears, and fix their eyes, that nothing may diſturb their minds, or divert their thoughts. When the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:172730:107"/>meat is fly-blown, it quickly corrupts; when our petitions to God are blown upon by worldly thoughts, and mingled with mental diſcourſes with men, they loſe their ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Some poor people whoſe houſes are troubled much with Vermine, have ſometimes a great part of their ſmall proviſion eaten up of Rats and Mice; truly, ſometimes a poor Chriſtian loſeth half a meal by theſe Vermine of Worldly thoughts, they devour ſometimes half his prayer. Reſolve before thou prayeſt to watch thy heart narrowly, that theſe may not hinder thee in prayer.</p>

To the <hi>matter</hi> of our prayers: Gods Word and Will muſt be the rule of our prayers, what we muſt ask of him, as well as of our practice what we muſt do for him: Subjects muſt ſet bounds to their deſires, and take heed that their petitions do not encroach upon the Prerogative Royal. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, what God commandeth us to act; Divine promiſes (what God engageth himſelf to do for us;) and Divine propheſies (what God hath foretold ſhall come to paſs) are to be the

                     </gap>alaam</hi> would needs ask leave of God, that he might be the Devils Chaplain to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but mark the iſſue, he hath an ironical conceſſion to go to his own deſtruction; the ſharp razour indeed of his tongue would not pierce the Iſraelites, who had armour of proof, but the ſword of the Iſraelites ſoon entred his body, and ſent his ſoul to receive its wages of that Maſter that ſet him a work.

                  </gap>kſgiving. We read of them, that when like Thieves they had robbed others, looked up to Heaven and bleſſed God for a good booty, that they had proſpered in their calling: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, feed the flock of the ſlaughter, whoſe poſſeſſors ſlay thee, and they that ſell them ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord I am rich</hi> Zach. 11.5, 6. That ſpurious Brat the Devil begot upon their curſed hearts, they lay at Gods door, as if he were its Father.</p>
               <p>Take heed Reader, of exceeding the limits of prayer: thoſe Beaſts which will not be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:172730:108"/>their bounds, are ſooneſt caught, and kild. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their wiſh to their woful coſt, when they cryed out, <hi>Would God we had dyed in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Numb. 14.27.28, 29. <hi>Be not unwiſe, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what the Will of the Lord is,</hi> Epheſ. 5.17. Indeed the Chriſtian may have any thing of God, if he do but in his prayer ſecure Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but he that exalteth his own will (not minding Gods) like a proud begger, will be a chuſer, and therefore he ſhall be ſent away either without an Alms, or elſe with the Serpents which he deſired, inſtead of the fiſh which he denyed. The Chriſtians Charter is wide enough, he hath no cauſe to defire its inlargement: <hi>And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> John 1.5, and 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Petitioner</hi> muſt be a <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> perſon, or the prayer will never be prevalent. He muſt be a favourite at Court, that preſenteth his ſupplication with confidence of ſucceſs. Others muſt pray and may ſpeed through Chriſt, but where there is no <hi>faith,</hi> there will be much <hi>fear</hi> about the event. The precept is to all, but the promiſe is onely to the beleiver: <hi>The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and deleivereth them out of all their troubles. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry,</hi> Pſa. 34.15, 17. Strangers may howl, and we take little notice what they ail, it is a venture whether we releive them or no, but if our children cry being in great diſtreſs, we haſten to their help.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:172730:109"/>Our relation to God may well ſtrengthen our hope, that our deſires ſhall be heard. He that can cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> may be confident of the ſucceſs of his ſuit, and that God will deal with him as a Son.</p>
               <p>Faith in Chriſt is eſſential to prayer, as I ſhewed in religious duties in general (and therefore omit it here:) now an unbeleiver goeth to God without the bleſſed Saviour, and therefore may well come away without an anſwer. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their prayers were ſtill to mind the Temple, either to pray in it, or towards it; which Temple was a type of Chriſt, the alone Altar upon which our prayers muſt be offered, if ever they be accepted, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.38. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. Kings will not gratifie or pardon Traytors, whilſt they continue in their Treaſonable deſignes. A ſinner even while he is wooing God for mercy, is warring againſt God; when his voice is the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> his hands are the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and therefore with what face can be expect favour; <hi>I will</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that men lift up holy hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. meaning in prayer. Where the hands are unholy and wicked the heart is worſe, and God cannot abide a ſtinking breath. Some write of <hi>Diacletes,</hi> that it hath many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues in it, but if it be put into the mouth of a man without life, it loſeth all. Prayer, (as I ſhewed before) hath many rare and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable qualities, but being in the mouth of one that is dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, it loſeth them all. When a vicious man propounded in the Roman Senate, a moſt excellent Law, they rejected the motion becauſe it was made by a bad mouth. When

The prayers of a natural man are like <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> ſhips which were made to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> for gold, but were broken by the way; they come ſhort of that merchandize which is better then ſilver, and that gain which is more precious then choice gold, for which they pretended to lanch forth: But the prayers of a regenerate perſon are like <hi>Solomons</hi> Navy, which were ſent forth to <hi>Ophir,</hi> went through with their voyage, and brought from thence four hundred and twenty Talents of gold: Unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the riches which the veſſel of his prayer returneth fraught with, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.48. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.28.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Our prayers muſt be <hi>humble:</hi> Prayer is one of our neareſt approaches to God on this ſide Heaven, in it we ſpeak to God mouth to mouth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be poured out with much humility. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> though ſhe rode along on the road, mounted

We are then moſt careful to put on our beſt raiment, when we go to ſpeak with great perſons. Subjects preſent their petitions to their Soveraigns upon their knees. <hi>O come let us Worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker,</hi> Pſa. 95.6. Princes muſt have ſilken words given them as the mother of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> told one, Our words to the great God muſt be ſubmiſſive.</p>
               <p>The ſpecial end of prayer, is to exalt God, and debaſe man; he therefore that is proud in that performance, doth wholly thwart Gods end in its inſtitution, and may be confident that God will thwart him in his petitions. When we go to God in this duty for grace and mercy, we do not go to him as thoſe that go to market to buy or relieve; but as thoſe that go to a rich mans door to beg an alms: And ſurely of all perſons beggars, who live wholly upon anothers charity, have leaſt reaſon to be proud. The proud beggar never got any thing at Gods door.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, how the children of God though they were never ſo rich in grace, were poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and humble in language and carriage, when they approached the Lord of glory: Every one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is reported of <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Cynick, that he uſed to fall on the ground before <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> when he preſented a petition to him.

He humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to open his eyes upon us, well may we be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when we open our mouthes and hearts to him, <hi>Job</hi> 14.3.</p>
               <p>Reader, if thou wouldſt have thy prayers heard, let them be humble. God loves to walk in the low valleys: <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſires of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, and wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God looketh not ſo much to the <hi>Elegancy</hi> of thy prayers, how neat they are, nor to the <hi>Geometry</hi> of thy prayers, how long they are, but to the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of thy prayers, how hearty they are.

Thy prayer without thy heart will be Sacriledge, not a Sacrifice.</p>

               <p>When the heart is <hi>Rector chori, cheif leader of the Quire,</hi> then the voice is pleaſant indeed in Gods ear. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth,</hi> Pſa. 145.18. When the Wife giveth the Husband her heart, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the Marriage bed, he will (if wiſe) bear with many infirmities in her. When the heart in prayer is devoted to God, he is pleaſed out of his grace and goodneſs, to pardon and paſs by many imperfections in the duty; but if that bed be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to any other, he gives a divorce to the Sacrifice, and putteth it away, for he is a jealous God. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſmall preſent could not but be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> becauſe it was the beſt of <hi>the Land.</hi> The heart of man is but little, yet it is the beſt of man, and therefore taken kindly by God. The main enquiry at prayer is concerning the heart; As <hi>Jonadab</hi> was asked by <hi>Jehu,</hi> ſo is the Chriſtian by God, <hi>Is thy heart right as mine is? Then come up into my Chariot; then come to the Throne of grace and welcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, thy prayers muſt be fervent: Prayer is a duty which conſiſteth not in words or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but in the working of the affection; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called a crying to God, <hi>Out of the depth I have cryed to thee,</hi> Pſa. 130. <hi>a renting the heart, Joel</hi> 2.13. as if the heart were by prayer torn in peices; and a pouring out the ſoul, as if the body had been left without life, the ſoul being depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aſcended to Heaven in holy petitions. The true Beggar is ever earneſt for ſpiritual Almes, he will not let God go without a bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:172730:112"/>
                  <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> being to fight with the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, would never give over Sacrificing to his God <hi>Hercules,</hi> till he had ſome ſign of victory. The Chriſtian is more urgent with the true God, then the Heathen is with his God of clouts. When <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed, with what force were his words uttered? with what fire was his Sacrifice offered? <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord defer not for the Lords ſake.</hi> That wine is beſt which is fulleſt of theſe heavenly ſpirits; Winter fruits are ſowre and unpleſant to men, and ſo are cold petitions to God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. Reader when thou art praying for pardon, how ſhouldſt thou even poure out thy ſoul! Alaſs when thou conſidereſt if God do not pardon, I periſh eternally; if ſin be imputed, I am damned, how ſhould thy heart cry out, <hi>Have mercy upon me O God, according to thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out mine iniquities;</hi> (again) <hi>Waſh me from mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and cleanſe me from my ſin;</hi> (and again) <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out all my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> (once more) <hi>Deliver me from blood guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. O God, thou God of my ſalvation,</hi> Pſa. 51.1, 2, 11, 14. When thou art begging grace and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with what earneſtneſs ſhouldſt thou pray? beleiving how deſtructive ſin is to thy precious ſoul, and how offenſive to the jealous, juſt and Almighty God, and in what abſolute neceſſity thou ſtandeſt in of holineſs, without which thou canſt never ſee God. As when the Clock ſtrikes, the Wheels within move notably, we may hear them run round, ſo when thy tongue is pleading with God
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:172730:113"/>for remiſſion of ſins, and repentance towards God, for the Son of God, the Spirit of God, and thine everlaſting Salvation, how ſhould thine heart move? what work ſhould there be among thine affections, to enforce thoſe weighty petitions? This fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency is neceſſary to prepare thy ſoul for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thou deſireſt: What men get lazily, they ſpend laviſhly; but that food which a devout woman longeth for, ſhe prizeth much, and eateth with moſt delight. When one whiſpered <hi>Demoſtenes</hi> in the ear that he was beaten, and deſired him to plead his cauſe, the Orator would not believe him, till at laſt the man cryed out. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I feel your cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the intenſion of the Spirit, which giveth efficacy to our petitions: It is not the length of the arm, but the ſtrength of it, which draweth the bow, ſo as to make the arrow fly faſt and far. Fervency to prayer, is as wings to the Bird, by which it mounteth up to heaven: <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of the righteous prevaileth much, James</hi> 5.16. When prayers are drivel'd, like rhume out of a mans mouth, they fall down at his feet. The Mother will let the childe alone, if it onely whimper and whine a little in the cradle, but when it crieth outright, then ſhe haſteth to take it up: <hi>This poor man cryed</hi> (was not dull and drowſie, there is his fervency) <hi>and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles,</hi> Pſal. 34.9. here is his prevalency. There is no getting to the Indian Mines by the cold Northerz Seas, though becauſe it is a ſhorter cut, ſome have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:172730:113"/>that way, but they loſt their labour. Other duties are <hi>a ſerving God,</hi> Prayer is <hi>a ſeeking God:</hi> Now <hi>they that ſeek him early ſhall finde him,</hi> Prov. 8.17. A low voice doth not cauſe a loud eccho, neither doth a lazy prayer procure a liberal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Sleepy requeſts cauſe but dreams, meer fancied returns. Where there is a cuſhion of eaſe under the knees, and a pillow of idleneſs under the elbows, there is little work to be done.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Daniel</hi> had been fervent all day at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, an Angel is ſent to him at night with an anſwer. Importunity prevaileth with an unjuſt Judge, much more with a righteous and gracious God: Though God be Almighty, yet a fervent prayer (through his grace) hath held his hands: <hi>Let me alone,</hi> Exod. 32. <hi>Who holdeth the Lord?</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin. Moſes</hi> earneſt cry was the cord, which I may ſpeak with reverence, faſtned Gods hands.</p>
               <p>Prayer is a ſword to wound both ſin and Satan, but fervency is the edge of it, doing the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 18.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>For this I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> When a man ſtrikes his Enemies with his full ſtrength, then the wounds are made.</p>
               <p>The lack of this fervency, is the loſs of many prayers. The lazy petition tires, before it comes half way to Heaven: indeed it is eaten up (as the cold honey of Waſps and Flies) of wandring thoughts; when fervent prayers, like honey boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the fire, is free from ſuch ill gueſts. An idle prayer, like a lazy beggar, wandreth and gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up and down, and as a rowling ſtone, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no moſs. The working of the affections in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:172730:114"/>prayer, like <hi>Davids</hi> harp, allayeth thoſe Devils which would diſturb the Chriſtian in this duty. When a man is intent upon the God to whom he prayeth, and eager after the mercies for which he prayeth, though the World whiſper him in the ear, he cannot hear; though Satan jog him by the elbow, he will not heed him.</p>
               <p>But here a caution will be ſeaſonable: The fire of thy fervency muſt be from Heaven; not ſuch ſtrange fire as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu.</hi> offered to the Lord: I mean, it muſt not be the voice of nature, an earneſt cry for the enjoyment of creatures; but the voice of the Spirit, an importunate deſire for conformity to, and communion with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We read of thoſe <hi>that howled upon their beds for corn, and wine, and oyl,</hi> Hoſea 7.17. Many, like children, roar, are much out of quiet, diſturb others with the noiſe they make, but it is for clouts for a Babey: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> The voice of a Saint muſt be, as of a wiſe ſon at full age, for the inheritance; <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Petitioner herein muſt be very careful; he that rides apace, had need to be ſure that he is in the right way, or elſe the freer his horſe is, the more he wandreth to his loſs. The greater the fire is, the more watchful we muſt be that it be kept within the chimney; the more earneſt our affections are, the more we muſt minde what our petitions be: The promiſes of God muſt be the <hi>foundation</hi> of our prayers. What he promiſeth to give, I may pray to receive: <hi>Remember the word
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:172730:114"/>unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope,</hi> Pſal. 119.49. but its dangerous for the <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to jet out</hi> (upon the Kings high-way) beyond the <hi>foundation;</hi> this may cauſe the houſe to fall, or be taken down. Becauſe <hi>godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life,</hi> I am bound to pray, <hi>Give me this day, my daily bread.</hi> Temporal good things muſt be part of the matter of my prayer; but becauſe God promiſeth theſe things conditionally (ſo far onely as he ſeeth fit for his honor, and my comfort) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt pray for them conditionally. The Apiſh childe that crieth and ſqueeketh for the knife, to be its own carver, and will not be ſatisfied with its Parents feeding it, deſerveth the rod; our prayers both for the matter and the manner, muſt run parallel with Gods promiſes. Prayer is a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods promiſes into ſuit; but he that ſueth a Bond, muſt minde the condition in it, or the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict will be to his coſt and damage. That which boils gently over a ſmall fire, may be of uſe to us, which if it ſhould boil haſtily, and run over, it may raiſe aſhes enough to ſpoil it ſelf. The way to loſe our requeſts for <hi>temporals,</hi> is to be as hot and haſty for them as if they were our <hi>all,</hi> even our <hi>eternals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That incomparable patern of prayers, the Lords Prayer (which is like a <hi>Standard-meaſure</hi> in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration Town, for preſent uſe, and an example for others) hath five petitions for Spirituals, and but one for Temporals.</p>
               <p>God hath promiſed ſpiritual things abſolutely, therefore thou mayeſt deſire them abſolutely: For
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:172730:115"/>pardon, and the image of God, and the blood of Chriſt, and fulneſs of joy in the other World, thou mayſt be as earneſt (ſo humble and reverent) as thou wilt. And O! what a mercy is it that God, though, like a wiſe father, he deny us leave to cry for the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which would burn, and the thorns which would prick our fingers; yet he giveth us liberty to, nay commandeth us to beſiege and ſtorm Heaven, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him up and down, to cry day and night, to give him no reſt, to be inſtant, urgent, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with him, that our perſons may be juſtified, our natures ſanctified, and our ſouls and bodies glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified eternally.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thy prayers muſt be <hi>conſtant:</hi> Thy duty is to <hi>give thy ſelf to prayer,</hi> as a ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to, and at the command of his noble Maſter. This fire, like that on the Altar, muſt never go out day nor night; <hi>Night and day praying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.10. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, as if his practice had been nothing but prayer; he did that ſo much, that he ſeemed to do nothing elſe. Prayer is a Saints breath, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly draweth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18 <hi>Praying alwayes, with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for all Saints.</hi> Thoſe that work in Iron Mills, keep a continual fire; though they ſuffer it ſometimes to ſlack or abate, yet never to go out: A Chriſtians prayer may have an intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but never a ceſſation.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour beſides his ſet times for ordinary, did pray whole nights: <hi>David</hi> was a

                     </gap>chim,</hi> the Father of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>that prayer was his meat and drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no duty injoyned a Chriſtian for his conſtant trade, ſo much as prayer; <hi>Pray always, pray continually, pray without ceaſing, pray with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, pray evermore.</hi> But why is all this? would God have his people do nothing elſe but pray? muſt they caſt by their callings, caſt off all care of their children, and ſhut themſelves up into ſome Cell or Cloyſter, and there be always upon their knees at prayer, as the Euchites fancied. No, I ſhall therefore give a brief deſcription of this praying without ceaſing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy ſoul muſt be ever in a praying frame.</hi> The Souldier hath his Weapons ready, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fight with his enemy. Thy heart muſt be ever in Tune, and ready upon the leaſt touch to make heavenly Muſick. The Churches lips are compared to an <hi>hony-comb,</hi> Cant. 4.11. The <hi>hony comb</hi> doth not always drop, but it is always ready to drop. The beleivers ſpirit is like fire upon the Hearth, though it do not blaze, yet its ready
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172730:116"/>upon any opportunity, to be blown up into a flame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No conſiderable buſineſs muſt be undertaken without prayer.</hi> Thou art Gods ſervant, and thy duty is to ask his leave in all thou doſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>In all things let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> When thou riſeſt up or lieſt down, when thou goeſt out or comeſt in, prayer muſt ſtill be with thee. Prayer is the way to prevent evil. The Worlds poiſon may be expelled with this antidote. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. He that converſeth with God by prayer, dwelleth in Heaven, and to ſuch a one the earth is but a ſmall point. Prayer is both a Charm to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and a ſcourge, to torment Satan. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth Chriſt in the combat with the Devil, and ſo aſſureth the ſoul of conqueſt. When the Saint is fighting and like to be foild, either by the World, the Fleſh, or the Wicked one, prayer is the Letter which he ſendeth Poſt to Heaven for freſh ſupplies of the ſpirit, whereby he <hi>becometh more then a conqueror.</hi> Prayer is the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure good, he that will not ſpeak, muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſpeed. It ſanctifieth our food, raymont, ſleep, callings, and all our enjoyments to us. The Chriſtian like the Chymiſt extracteth all good things out of this one body of prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that prayeth conſtantly, <hi>hath ſet times every day for prayer;</hi> The Morning and Evening Sacrifice were called the <hi>continual Sacrifice.</hi> Numb. 28.4. The Chriſtian hath his ſet meals for his ſoul every day, as well as for his body. With the Mary-gold he opens himſelf in the morning, for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172730:116"/>the ſweet dews of Heavens grace and bleſſing, and he doth at night (though his occaſions hinder him in the day) like a Lover find ſome opportunity to converſe with his beloved.</p>
               <p>He is moſt free and freſh in the morning, <hi>the top of the milk is the cream,</hi> and he doth not think his beſt too good for God. His evening fare is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time extraordinary, like the Jewiſh feaſts which were at Supper. The ſpiced cup is beſt at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Prayer is the key of the morning, to open the door of mercy, and prayer is the bolt at night to ſhut him up in ſafety. The Jews prayed in the Temple the third, ſixth, and ninth hour of the day; our priviledges under the Goſpel are enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and I know no reaſon why our prayers ſhould be leſſened.</p>
               <p>He that prayeth continually, doth upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in the day time, whatever he be about, put up his ſupplication to God. He hath his ejaculations his holy Apoſtrophes, wherein he doth turn his ſpeech (at leaſt internal and inarticulate) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om man to God. This liberty is a great priviledge, and this practice turnes to wonderful profit. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was bleſſing his Sons, he takes breath with, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation O Lord,</hi> Gen 49.14. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when at the Kings Elbow, would not open his mouth to the King, till he had opened his heart to God. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Noah</hi> was curſing <hi>Cham:</hi> he had a ſhort ejaculation for a bleſſing on <hi>Japhet, God ſhall perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> which prayer hath been anſwered, and will be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:172730:117"/>to the end of the World; We Gentiles fare the better for that prayer: Chriſt upon the Croſs dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up a ſhort ejaculatory prayer, for his Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,</hi> and as an anſwer to it, we find ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them preſently converted.</p>
               <p>Truely Reader, I would commend theſe ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as an excellent receipt for all companies, and in all conditions. If thou art a ſtranger to it, thou doſt not know the vertue of it. It is as ſome write of the herb <hi>Panaces, a univerſal remedy for all diſeaſes,</hi> a ſpecial though cheap preſervative both againſt the evil of ſin and ſuffering. This is the beſt way to avoid dangers, to overcome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to proſper us in our lawful deſigns, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.12.</p>
               <p>When thou receiveſt a ſudden mercy, heareſt unexpected good news, thou mayſt preſently rear an Altar, and offer up a Sacrifice of praiſe to God. If thou art protected through grace from any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, in which thou waſt falling, or afflictions of which thou waſt affraid, thou mayſt ſuddenly diſpatch a Meſſenger to Heaven with thanks, who will be more welcome there, then thou art aware of. So did a good Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.26. and a godly Souldier and governour, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.15. I will bleſs the Lord at all times ſaith <hi>David,</hi> his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth. When thou art in a ſuddain plunge, thou mayſt dart up a thought to God for counſel or protection: theſe ſhort breathings, would prepare thee for a long race.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:172730:117"/>
               <p>There are indeed ſome ſeaſons for prayer, which muſt by no means be ſlighted; when the Spirit of God ſtirreth in thee, and cometh for thee, then make haſte to God. Courtiers watch for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſeaſons to preſent their petitions to their Kings, and will be ſure to lay hold of ſuch ſeaſons. If the King himſelf offer any diſcourſe relating to their requeſts, then they will cloſe and ſtrike in: When the Spirit of God in a morning or evening, or in the day time, commandeth thee to go and cry to God for pardon and life (I ſpeak of regular motions, for no other come from the Spirit) then is a fit time to preſent thy requeſts, he ſendeth for thee for that end: Take heed of delaying or denying; <hi>Thou ſaidſt ſeek ye my face, my heart ſaid, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> Suitors have their <hi>molliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima tempora fandi, their ſpecial times of wooing. Heſter</hi> waited once and again for a fit time to beg her life, and the lives of her people, of the King; and when <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> put her upon it, gave her an opportunity, ſhe then did it, and prevailed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever actions thou entreſt upon, whether Civil, Natural, or Religious, let prayer be to thee, as the Baptiſt to Chriſt, <hi>the meſſenger to prepare the way before thee. Bonaventure,</hi> that Seraphical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, being aſked by <hi>Aquinas, How he got ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge?</hi> pointing to a Crucifix in his ſtudy, ſaid, <hi>Ille eſt liber meus, by praying to that Crucifix:</hi> A Chriſtian by praying to God, in the name of a crucified Chriſt, may get <hi>ſaving knowledge.</hi> Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of this, thoſe mercies will be moſt ſavoury, which come flying to thee upon the wings of prayer.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:172730:118"/>Thoſe favours are ſuſpicious, which ſteal in at a window, and come not in at the door of prayer. How ſweet was that water to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whieh ſtreamed to him in the channel of prayer, <hi>Judges</hi> 15.19. he called the name of it <hi>En-hakkore, the well of him that prayed. Jacob</hi> ſaw God ſmiling, in <hi>Eſau's</hi> ſmooth countenance, becauſe prayer was the Sun which ſcattered and cleared that sky. When thou canſt ſay of the mercy which God giveth thee, as <hi>Hannah</hi> of <hi>Samuel, For this childe I prayed</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>he is the travel of my ſoul, as well as of my body; he is the fruit of my heart, as well as of my womb;</hi> when thou muſt ſay, <hi>For this bleſſing I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many a time did I weep and make ſupplication, and lo I have prevailed.</hi> Such a mercy will be a double mercy, a <hi>Samuel</hi> indeed <hi>Asked of God,</hi> and Dedicated to God.</p>
               <p>As Jeſus Chriſt was more welcome to <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, when ſhe and his Father had ſought him ſorrowing; ſo thoſe bleſſings, eſpecially ſpiritual, will be received with moſt joy, which were ſought with moſt ſorrow: What thou <hi>winneſt</hi> with <hi>prayer,</hi> thou wilt <hi>wear</hi> with <hi>prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be Reader, thou art one that art ſo far from conſtant praying, that the garment of the Atheiſt will fit thy back very well: <hi>They call not upon God,</hi> Pſal. 14.4. if ſo, bethink thy ſelf, for thou liveſt like a Beaſt, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did, though thou haſt the ſhape of a man: <hi>They are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brutiſh, and have not ſought the Lord,</hi> Jer. 10.21. <hi>Brutes</hi> are like <hi>Mutes:</hi> O it is a dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to be <hi>poſſeſſed with a dumb Devil.</hi> When
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:172730:118"/>men once grow ſpeechleſs, its a ſign death is hard by. If that bloody Butcher can but muzzle thy mouth, and with cords hinder thy crying, expect the ſtroke of the ax: Or poſſibly that livery which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> made for <hi>Job,</hi> though it was much below him, yet will become thee, <hi>Thou reſtraineſt prayer before God,</hi> Job 15.4. The pulſe of thy ſoul faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; thou layeſt by thy prayers, as ſome do their beſt cloathes, till they go to Church again, or for ſome Holy-day. O this is a ſad ſign that prayer, which ſhould be thy element, is thy torment. Friends that love one another, long to converſe together, and take all opportunities of ſending to, and hearing from each other: Hadſt thou any love to the bleſſed God, it would be ſo with thee. But as painfulneſs in ſpeaking, often argueth unſound inwards, ſo thy inconſtancy in praying, giveth thee cauſe of ſuſpecting thy ſpiritual unſoundneſs and inſincerity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>The Subſequent duties after Prayer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THirdly, I ſhall ſpeak to the conſequents, or thoſe duties which muſt follow after prayer; and they are principally two, <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Watching</hi> for an anſwer: Pious prayers are precious commodities; and who, unleſs a mad man or a fool, will throw away what is of value and worth? When thou haſt ſhot thine arrow, obſerve
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:172730:119"/>where it lights, and how near it flew to the mark. Wiſe men when they have delivered their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Prince, watch and wait ſometimes a year together, all the while longing and looking for an anſwer: Thy requeſts to God are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite concernment, thy Heaven, thy eternal happineſs is involved in them; with what holy impatience then ſhouldſt thou deſire an anſwer? <hi>In the morning I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up,</hi> Pſa. 5.3. The words diſcover <hi>Davids poſture</hi> in prayer, and his <hi>practice</hi> after prayer: His <hi>poſture</hi> in prayer, <hi>I will direct my prayer unto thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſponam tibi Calvin.</note> The word is an alluſion to an <hi>Archer,</hi> or to a <hi>General,</hi> as ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve on it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To an <hi>Archer,</hi> and then the meaning is, <hi>I will be up betimes, and take as good aim as I can poſſibly at the mark, and ſo draw my bow, and direct my arrow that I may hit it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To a <hi>General,</hi> and then it importeth thus much, <hi>I will riſe early, and ſet my requeſts to God, as Souldiers in Battalia, in rank and file, in good array: I will ſo marſhal them, that they be not rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by being out of order: I will ſee that they ſtand in their places, and keep their ground;</hi> and what then? his <hi>practice</hi> after prayer, <hi>And will look up:</hi> I will obſerve what became of the arrow I ſhot. Or the word being an alluſion to a <hi>Watchman,</hi> as the former word to a <hi>Commander in chief of an Army,</hi> ſpeaketh this, <hi>When I have marſhalled my prayers in good array, and ſent them forth to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſpiritual Enemies, and to wreſtle with God himſelf for his grace and love, I will get up to my
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:172730:119"/>Watch-Tower, to ſee what execution they do upon my adverſaries, what power they have with God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they get or loſe ground, whether they prevail and win the day.</hi> It was the cuſtome in thoſe days, when forces were ſent forth to fight, for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to command one to watch in ſome high place, if he could ſpie any coming from the Armies with news. So when <hi>Davids</hi> Souldiers were engaged with <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> the <hi>watchman went up to the roof over the gate,</hi> and ſpied <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> and <hi>Cuſhi</hi> coming with tidings. Thus holy <hi>David</hi> ſtood (as it were) <hi>ſentinel</hi> and watched as a ſpie, longing every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hear and ſee the event, iſſue and ſucceſs of his prayers.</p>
               <p>Men that work for a <hi>dead horſe,</hi> as we ſay, when their buſineſs is done, look no further, becauſe they had their pay before-hand; but thoſe whoſe reward is behind, labour in expectation of it, and after they have wrought, look for it: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleivers hopes are in this preſent world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he procure but ſome earthly profit, it is no wonder if he look no more after his prayers, he had his pay before hand: But a beleiver whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (not of debt but of grace) is ever behind and to come, while he is upon earth, when he hath prayed in obedience to Gods precept, cannot but expect the performance of Gods promiſe.</p>
               <p>He that ventureth nothing in a ſhip, ſave a ſmall parcel of pins, or a few quire of paper, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is little better then nothing, takes little thought what becomes of the veſſel, if it ſink or ſwim, its all one to him, he loſeth not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:172730:120"/>ſleep for it. But the Merchant who ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all he is worth in a Veſſel, and ſendeth it out very richly laden, though it be a long journey, yet he is impatient to hear of it: many an anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thought hath he about it, many a time he putteth the ſuppoſition to himſelf, <hi>What if this Ship ſhould miſcarry? What will become of me, my Wife and Children?</hi> He can hardly eat or drink with comfort, or ſleep with quietneſs, till he hears it is ſafe. A wicked man that is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ventureth nothing in his prayers, and therefore whether they miſcarry or no, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much with him: when he prayed for pardon and grace, he counted them little worth, he prized his ſtock and his riches at a far higher rate, and ſo muſt needs be very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether the Veſſel wherein things of ſuch ſmall worth (in his eſteem) were hazarded, come home ſafe or no. But a godly man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth all he is worth, for this, and the other world, in his prayers: he knoweth that all his happineſs is involved in the pardon of his ſins, in the righteouſneſs of his Saviour, in the love of his God, and the renovation of his nature, all which he beggeth with ſtrong cries and groans. He eſteemeth theſe things as the very <hi>life of his life,</hi> and <hi>the very ſoul of his ſoul,</hi> and <hi>O</hi> (thinks he) <hi>how richly laden, is this Veſſel which I have ſent forth! My precious ſoul, my deareſt Jeſus, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the covenant of grace, my eternal fruition of the ever bleſſed God, are all aboard her. If ſhe ſhould miſcarry</hi> (good Lord) <hi>what would become
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:172730:120"/>of me? I am loſt, I am damned, I am undone eternally. Was ever Ship better fraught? Her burden is of ineſtimable value. My joy, my peace, my love, my delight, my hope, my heaven, my all, are in her. Oh what ſhould I do, if the Arch-pirate Satan ſhould ſeiſe her? or if ſhe ſhould ſplit upon the rock of my preſumption? or ſink in the quicksands of my infidelity? Alaſs, alaſs, whether ſhould I go? where ſhould I appear?</hi> Such a ſoul never failed of a rich return of his venture.</p>
               <p>Reader, when thou haſt prayed, wait and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an anſwer. Though thy prayers were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with many imperfections, if they were the travail of thy ſoul, (upright I mean) do not give them over for loſt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> Mother could keep him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe made an Ark of Bul-ruſhes, and dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it with Pitch, and put him in, and hid it in the Flags, by the River brink; and his Siſter ſtood a far off, to ſee what would become of him. <hi>And Pharaohs daughter came to waſh her ſelf, ſpied the Ark, ſent and fetched it, the babe wept and ſhe had compaſſion on it:</hi> ſent for the Mother, gave it her to nurſe, paid for its nurſing and the Child became the great deliverer of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Truely ſo when the fruit of thy heart, thy tears and ſighs, and groans, and prayers, are ready in the eye of ſenſe to be given over for dead, they lie float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the water, let thy faith and hope be near at hand, to ſee what will become of them; the Kings Son may take pity on the weeping babe,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:172730:121"/>pay the charge of its nurſing up, bringing it into favour at the heavenly Court, and make it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for the conducting thy ſoul through the Wilderneſs of this World, towards the true and celeſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the Meſſenger thou ſendeſt to Heaven tarry long, yet wait and expect his return. Thoſe that ſend to the Indies for the golden wedges, wait many months, though they long every moment for their arrival.</p>
               <p>If after thy expectation, thou findeſt little fruit of thy petitions, do not therefore lay aſide that calling, <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch in the ſame,</hi> Col. 4.2. Anglers, though they have fiſhed many hours and caught nothing, do not therefore break their Cane, and Line, but draw out their hook, and look upon their bait, which (it may be) was fallen off, or not well hung on, and mend it, and then throw it in again; So when thou haſt been earneſt in prayer, and yet received no anſwer, reflect upon thy prayers, conſider whether ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were not amiſs, either in thy preparation for the duty, or in the matter or manner of thy petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is poſſible thou mighteſt deſire ſtones inſtead of bread, or fuel for thy luſts, or didſt forget to deliver thy petitions to the onely Maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the Lord Jeſus, that he might preſent it to the Father, if any of theſe were the fault, no wonder if they failed; what ever it be, be diligent to find it out, amend it and fall to thy work again with confidence, that thou ſhalt not work at the labour in vain. The Archer if he ſhoot once, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:172730:121"/>again, and miſs the mark, conſidereth what the reaſon was, whether he did not ſhoot too high, or too low, or too much on the right hand, or too much on the left hand, takes the ſame Arrow again, onely reformeth his former error, and winneth the wager.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Working</hi> is neceſſary after prayer, as well as <hi>Watching.</hi> Begging and Digging muſt go together. Thy duty is to pray, as knowing aſſuredly that thou canſt do nothing of thy ſelf, and yet to work as if thou wert to do all by thine own power. He that doth not indeavour in a lawful uſe of thoſe meant which God affordeth him to attain the mercies he needeth and asketh, doth <hi>tempt,</hi> not <hi>truſt</hi> God, and may expect a rod ſooner then releif. A good uſe may be made of that ſtory; A Carter having over-thrown his Cart, ſat in the way crying, <hi>help Hercules, help, (Hercules</hi> was counted by the Heathen a God for his ſtrength) <hi>O Hercules help.</hi> At length one appeared to him in <hi>Herculus</hi> ſhape, with a good Cudgel in his hand, and beat him handſomely; ſaying, <hi>Ah thou ſilly lazy fellow, doſt thou call to me for help, and ſit ſtill thy ſelf, ariſe and ſet to thy ſhoulder, do thy part, and I will do the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou prayeſt for thy dayly bread, be thou diligent in thy calling, or elſe expect a crop out of the Ocean. If thou prayeſt againſt ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, avoid the occaſions of thoſe ſins. If it be againſt Drunkenneſs, avoid evil company; If it be againſt Pride, avoid and diſcourage ſuch as will flatter thee, for otherwiſe thou doſt as he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172730:122"/>that runneth into the fire, and prayeth to God that it may not burn him; ſuch a man mocketh God, but himſelf moſt; if thou prayeſt for Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Grace, hear, read, meditate, watch, uſe the means, and expect a good iſſue from God.</p>
               <p>Obſerve <hi>David,</hi> his prayer was, <hi>Set a watch O Lord before my mouth, keep the door of my lips, Pſa.</hi> 141.3. But now becauſe he had committed the main charge of this unruly priſoner, <hi>his tongue,</hi> to God, deſiring him to lock the double doors of his lips and teeth faſt upon it, and to have a main guard always watching before the doors, leaſt it ſhould break through and attempt an eſcape, doth he therefore ſleep himſelf, thinking the priſoner was ſafe enough? no, he himſelf would be upon the guard. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my ways that I ſin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a a bridle while the wicked is before me, Pſal.</hi> 39.1, 2. <hi>David</hi> as he deſired God to put a good bit into the mouth of this wanton beaſt, ſo he would himſelf keep a ſtrict hand and rein him in.</p>

When Heathen ſhall be thrown into the Goal of Hell, and bound with chains of everlaſting darkneſs, their own conſciences will hinder them from the leaſt thought of commencing a ſuite againſt God for falſe impriſonment, becauſe they are judged not by the <hi>Law Moral,</hi> written in Tables of ſtone, but by the <hi>Law Natural,</hi> written in the Tables of their hearts.</p>
               <p>But out of his infinite favour, he is pleaſed to give ſome (in thoſe places where he intendeth to gather a people to himſelf, for his eternal praiſe) beſide the twinkling <hi>Star-light of nature,</hi> the clear and perfect <hi>Sun-light of Scripture, to guide their feet in the ways of peace;</hi> Which word is one of the moſt ſignal mercies, that ever he beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sons of men, the whole World without it, being but a barren and rude Wilderneſs.</p>

When Kings ſend out their Proclamations, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning acts of grace, or ſome Law which their Subjects ought to obey, they expect that all ſhould take notice of them, and give them the reading and hearing. What an affront doſt thou offer to the King of the whole World, if thou turneſt thy back upon his word? I muſt tell thee, it is no leſs then <hi>crimen loeſae Majeſtatis. He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luke 10.16.

               <p>It is a mercy that the Tree of Knowledge, the Word of God, is not forbidden, but commanded fruit; nay, that it groweth in the very path to the Tree of life: O why ſhouldſt thou then like the Phariſees, <hi>reject the counſel of God againſt thy own ſoul?</hi> If thou art a childe of <hi>Adam,</hi> I am ſure thou haſt thy deaths wound; now by neglecting the Word, thou like a frantick Patient, throweſt away that plaiſter which onely can cure thee.</p>
               <p>Do not ſay thou waſt not warned of thy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and duty: I do here ſhew thee the hand and ſeal of the King of kings to that Warrant to which I require thy <hi>obedience.</hi> The Scripture is <hi>the Word of Chriſt,</hi> and God commandeth thee upon thine allegiance to <hi>hear him,</hi> Coloſ. 3.16.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Empty thine heart of evil frames, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Evil frames.</hi> The diſh muſt not be ſluttiſh,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:172730:129"/>into which we put theſe ſpiritual dainties. If the ſtomach be cloged with filth and flegm, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digeſt and concoct our food. The light of the Sun, as pleaſant and delightful as it is to ſound, is yet offenſive and painful to ſore eyes. This part of preparation is injoyned us by the Spirit of God. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all filthineſs, and all ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls,</hi> Jam. 1.21. If the body be feaveriſh, the ſweeteſt Syrup will taſt bitter; If any ill humour or luſt be predominant in thee, like the full and foul ſtomach thou wilt loath even the hony comb. The Table book of thine heart muſt be wiped clean, before any new thing (as the Law of God) can be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it. Briars and Thorns muſt be ſtubbed up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground be capable of the grain.</p>
               <p>As <hi>evil humours</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught, ſo prejudice againſt the perſon teaching, muſt be removed. Prejudice againſt the Preacher, is the greateſt prejudice to the Hearer.

But ſuppoſe thy teacher, at leaſt in thy thoughts, is a man of mean parts, wilt thou thence conclude, his pains will yeild thee little profit
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:172730:129"/>Truely ſhouldſt thou gratifie Satan ſo far, it would be the ſpeedieſt way to find a truth in what thou doſt fancy.

               <p>Reader, if the fault be not thine own, thou mayeſt gain much (nay I muſt ſay) moſt good by plain preaching. Thoſe that dwell by the Sea ſide gather up thoſe precious commodities (bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sea, at the death or wrack of the ſhip) when the Sea is loweſt, which they cannot do when the waters are higheſt: I do not here plead for vain repetitions, and tedious circumlocutions; nor for them that dreſs their meat ſo ſlovenly that their Gueſts loath it. I know its below the Majeſtie of a King, when he is delivering his minde by his Ambaſſador, to play the Orator; but it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to ſpeak ſenſe and reaſon. Wiſe men love a neat, compact diſcourſe, but it muſt be more full of matter then words, convincing the judgement, and working upon the affections. Plain, ſolid Sermons, are moſt acceptable to pious and ſerious ſouls: There is a vaſt difference between waſhing the face of a Diſcourſe clean, and painting it; the former is lawful and commendable, the latter ſinful and abominable. Miniſters muſt minde the capacities of their Auditories, and not put that meat into their mouthes which their teeth cannot chew, nor their ſtomachs concoct: Their Sermons of <hi>quiddities, haeccieties,</hi> and School nicities, may (in the opinion of giddy men) tend to their own praiſe, but never to their hearers profit: Such men when their children ask bread, give them ſtones which may <hi>choak</hi> them, but will not <hi>cheriſh</hi> them. It is pity he ſhould ever teach School, that will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:172730:131"/>not ſpeak to his Scholars, ſo as they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him.</p>
               <p>But the worſt ſuppoſition is, Thy Teacher may be untaught himſelf; his life may give the lye to his lips. As to this prejudice, 1. Remember, That an accuſation muſt not be received againſt an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, except under two or three witneſſes; thy chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, O Chriſtian, and the Dignity of his Calling, muſt both move thee to be ſlow to believe. As it is ſinful to raiſe up an evil report (<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor ſaid, <hi>That if he ſaw a Biſhop committing uncleanneſs, he would rather cover that foul fact with his Imperial robe, then ſuffer it to be divulged to the diſhonor of the Goſpel</hi>) ſo it is ſinful to take up an evil report, whoever laid it down ready for thee. But ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if thy Paſtor, like a wooden Veſſel, giveth that wine to thee which he never taſteth, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth himſelf, be not therefore wholly diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: If it be true, that thy Miniſter is falſe to God and his own ſoul, that he onely wears Chriſts livery, that he might the more unſuſpected do the Devils work: I confeſs it is matter of great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation (the good Lord take care either for their converſion or ejection) for certainly they being liſted under Chriſts colours, and falſe to their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, do his adverſary the Devil double ſervice. The ſins of Teachers are, the Teachers of ſins; they who forget their Sermons, will remember their ſins, to patronize their own: But if the providence of God ſhould binde thee to ſuch a Paſtor, which is no ſmall unhappineſs; conſider, that God fed <hi>Elijah</hi> by a Raven, and ſurely he can feed thee by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:172730:131"/>an unclean creature. He increaſeth ſometimes his <hi>Enemies gifts</hi> that they might be inſtrumental to increaſe his peoples graces. It is unqueſtionable in my judgement (though ſome I know doubt it) that a ſinner may convert a ſoul; and my reaſon is this, becauſe the operation of the word doth not depend upon the piety of the Preacher, but upon the free grace and power of the Lord. Yet I muſt alſo confeſs that I beleive that God doth not ſo often vouchſafe to his enemies as to his friends, that honour and happineſs. But as bad as he is, God may uſe him to do thee good. As the beſt Miniſters Sermons are not to be received for their good lives ſake, ſo the worſt Miniſters Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not to be rejected becauſe of their evil practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A blind man may hold a Candle to give light to others, whilſt he himſelf remains in the dark; the Sun of righteouſneſs may convey the light of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the houſe of thine heart, through this ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Window. Thou mayſt derive water from the Fountain of life, through a leaden pipe; A deaf bell may be uſeful to call a Chriſtian to Church, and he that never heard ſo as to live, may call a ſoul to Chriſt. Wholeſom Sugar may be in a poiſoned Cane.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Jewels were helpful to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; <hi>David</hi> made the ſpoiles of the Gentiles, ſervice able to the Temple; and ſurely the ſon of <hi>David</hi> can make the parts and guifts of an <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> an Enemy to God ſerviceable to thy ſoul.

Urge thy ſoul with this, <hi>The word which I am going to hear, in regard of the ordination of God, is abſolutely neceſſary to my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good. I am dead, and it is the word that muſt enliven me; I am blind, &amp; it is the word that muſt enlighten me. It is abſolutely neceſſary that I know my ſins and miſery; now the word muſt do this, and is therefore called a glaſs,</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that I know my Saviour, and the way of my recovery; now the word muſt do this, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called faith and life,</hi> Joh. 6.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:172730:132"/>to open mine eyes to ſee Chriſt, to open my heart to receive Chriſt, and that Heaven hereafter may be open to my poor ſoul. My ſoul is ſinful, and its the word that muſt ſanctifie it; My ſoul is ſick, it is the word that muſt heal it; My ſoul is hungry, and its the word muſt feed it, or I ſhall ſtarve; My ſoul is thirſty, and its the word that muſt ſatisfie it, or I ſhall die for thirſt; whatſoever conditions of miſery I am in, it is the word that muſt give ſutable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſupport me; whatſoever relations of life I ſtand in, it is the word that muſt give ſutable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to direct me; whatſoever ſervice I am called to, whether of doing or ſuffering, it is the word which muſt releive me with ſutable ſupply. O, of what concernment is this word to my well being, in this and the other World! I muſt be ſanctified, or I can never be ſaved; I muſt turn to God, or burn in hell; and the word muſt do this for me, or it will never be done; good Lord how ſhould I hear!</hi> Men are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about things which are indifferent, but they are careful about things that are abſolutely neceſſary; Neceſſity makes men ſtrive oftentimes beyond their ſtrength.

               <p>Now Reader, think with thy ſelf thus, <hi>I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear that Word which hath God for its Author, Jeſus Chriſt for its matter, and Eternal Life for its end: Shall I like a beaſtly Swine, trample theſe inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Jewels under my feet? ſhall that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more precious then fine gold, be eſteemed by me as dirt? It is the picture of Gods own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; how chary ſhould I be of the picture, for the Perſons ſake? Ah, how tender ſhould I be of that glaſs, which hath wine in it more worth then Heaven and Earth? Would it not be a thouſand pities that I ſhould ſuffer the Flies of my wandring thoughts, to corrupt and ſpoil this Box of Precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider the <hi>efficacy</hi> of it: The revealed Word is like the eſſential Word; <hi>for the fall, as well as for the riſe of many in Iſrael.</hi> As there is nothing ſo evil, but a ſerious holy perſon may get good out of it, like ſome Creatures we read of, he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and fetch nouriſhment out of Serpents; ſo there is nothing ſo good, but a careleſs, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart may pervert to his hurt; like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he may ſuck poyſon out of the ſweeteſt Roſe. The Word will work one way or other; if it work not for thy ſalvation, it will work for thy damnation; if it be not a ſavour of life to life, it will be a ſavour of death to death: <hi>As the rain cometh down and watereth the earth, and returneth not thither again; ſo ſhall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return unto me void, Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11. The Word is compared to fire: Fire doth either purifie the mettal, or conſume it;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:172730:134"/>the Word will either convert thee, or confound thee. The Sea ſinks ſome Veſſels, and lands others ſafely; the Scripture will either further thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, or towards Hell: <hi>The ways of the Lord are right, and the juſt ſhall walk in them; but the tranſgreſſors ſhall fall therein,</hi> Hoſea 14. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark Reader, what an Engine is here to ſcrew thee up to the greateſt attention to the Word which is poſſible? It is like ſtrong phyſick to a perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſick, which either mends them, or ends them. Think thus with thy ſelf, <hi>I am going to hear that Word which will not be in vain, but will either kill me, or cure me; this Sword of the Spirit is ſharp and keen; if it doth not defend me, it will deſtroy me: O it is bad jeſting with ſuch edged tools! How ſad will it be for me to finde death about the lips of Chriſt, to fall into Hell with a ſtumble at the Goſpel of the Kingdom of Heaven? How exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am I concerned to ſet my heart to all the words which</hi> I <hi>ſhall hear this day? for it is not a vain thing, but it is for my life,</hi> Deut. 32.46, 47.</p>
               <p>Urge thy ſoul in earneſt with theſe particulars. As <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſtretching himſelf upon the young dead child, at laſt got life and quickning into it; ſo thou forcing and ſtretching, as it were, theſe things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy heart, mayſt quicken it, how dull and dead ſoever it is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thou wouldſt prepare thy ſelf for the Word, <hi>entreat God to bleſs it to thee:</hi> The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit muſt accompany the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Word, or it will be ineffectual: <hi>It
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:172730:134"/>is the Spirit that quickneth, John</hi> 6.63. The fire burneth naturally, and the water cooleth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if the fire of the Word ever burn up thy corruptions, or the water of the Word refreſh thee with real conſolations, it muſt not be by its own nature, but by a Divine power. If thine eye be opened by that eye-ſalve of Scripture, to ſee Chriſt in his native beauty, or thy ſelf in thy natural deformity, God muſt anoint thine eyes therewith; therefore <hi>David</hi> beggeth this favour at Gods hand, <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may ſee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things out of thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.18. As good ſight as <hi>David</hi> had, he could not read in Gods Law, without Gods light. If the door of thine heart be opened by this key, to give admiſſion to the King of Glory, Gods hand muſt turn the key. The Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia, that ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the words of Paul,</hi> Acts 16. <hi>Paul</hi> might have preached his heart out, before <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart would have opened to let the Word in, if God had not undertaken the work.</p>
               <p>If the Sword of the Word pierce thy ſoul, hack and hew, and ſlay thy moſt beloved ſins (thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies within thee, which would not have Chriſt to reign over thee) the arm of the Lord muſt weild it: <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. Surely that voice of Thunder muſt come from Heaven, which can pluck up the ſtrong trees of thy natural unbelief and ſenſleſsneſs,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:172730:135"/>and pull down the high Towers of pride and ſelf. If the Word, which is called a Seal (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.) ever imprint thy Saviours Image on thee to thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, God muſt adde weight to the Seal, or it will make no ſtamp: <hi>He hath of his own will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten you by the Word of Truth,</hi> James 1.21. He that made the Watch, can make it ſtrike right; and he that made the Word, can make it ſtrike home, even <hi>to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow,</hi> Hebr. 4.12. If the Word which is called life (<hi>John</hi> 6.63.) quicken thee to thine eternal Salvation, God muſt breathe on thy dry bones, and bid thee <hi>live: I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Rom. 1.16.</p>
               <p>It was the Angels troubling the waters, which made the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> medicinal to the diſeaſed people: And it is not the water of the Word which can heal thy ſoul-ſickneſſes, unleſs the Angel of the Covenant work in it, and with it.</p>

                  <hi>Elijahs</hi> mantle could not divide the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> but the Lord God of <hi>Elijah</hi> did it: The Preacher may ſhew thee thy Leſſon, but God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can help thee to learn it.</p>

There is a thick film in thine ears naturally, which hindreth thine hearing; thine ears are ſtopt, that Sermons can have no paſſage: Now God alone can with his Seringer diſſolve the wax congealed there, and break through the skin, whereby thou mayeſt come to hear, and live.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:172730:135"/>Remember, that the ſeeing eye, and the hearing ear, the Lord hath <hi>made them both,</hi> Prov. 20.12. Therefore intreat him to open thine eyes, that thou mayſt ſee his comely face, in the Glaſs of the word, and to open thine ears that thou mayſt hear his lovely voice in the word, and to open thine heart that thou mayſt receive grace from him through the word. Say as <hi>David, Shew me thy way O Lord, teach me thy paths. Make me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the way of thy precepts, ſo ſhall I talk of thy wondrous works,</hi> Pſa. 25.4. Pſa. 119.27. And be not diſcouraged either at the miſteriouſneſs of the word, or at thine own dulneſs; for he that made the lock, can help thee to a key that will fit all its wards.</p>
               <p>But be ſure thou forget not to commend thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to God. As thy duty is to beg a <hi>door of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> for thy ſelf, ſo a <hi>door of utterance</hi> for thy Paſtor. <hi>Withall praying for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to ſpeak the myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 4.3. Epheſ. 6.19. Thy profit by him will be not a little furthered by thy prayer for him. He that loves his child, will often remember the Nurſe that feeds it. He that loves his precious ſoul, will often mind the Preacher that prepareth and bringeth its ſpiritual portion. I have known ſome to praiſe their Cooks highly, when they would prevail with them to dreſs a Diſh curiouſly for their palates. I am ſure thy way is to pray for thy Paſtor fervently, if thou wouldſt have him provide ſuch food as may be for thy ſouls pleaſure and profit. Starve the Mother, and you ſtarve the child in her womb. If the Heavens do not favour the Hils with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:172730:136"/>ſhours, they cannot fatten the Valleys with their chalky ſtreams. If the Pipes be broke which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey water to our houſes from the River, we can expect no ſupply.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let thine end <hi>in going to hear, be to pleaſe God and profit thy ſoul.</hi> Propound a good endin hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if thou wouldſt have a good end of hearing; Some go to Church for nothing, like the Athenians, the greateſt part knew not wherefore they were met together, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. They have as much as they come for; They come for nothing, and they often go away with nothing. Others go to carp and catch at the Preacher; as the <hi>Herodians</hi> went to Chriſt to entangle him in his talk, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.15. Theſe go not to hear Gods word, but to do the Devils work, and he will pay them their wages. Theſe flie to the carcaſs, not to defend it, but to devour it. A third ſort go to hear wit and parts, neat expreſſions, and an affecting graceful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation, like the Jews to hear <hi>Ezekiel, Lo thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> Ezek. 33.32. Theſe go to hear man, not to hear God. They hear out of curioſitie, not out of conſcience; they deſire to have their ears tickled, not their hearts touched. They hear and do not, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. Such go to Church, juſt as they who go to a noiſe of Muſitions, onely for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſound, for nothing but to hear.</p>
               <p>Reader, take heed of theſe and other finful ends, leaſt God anſwer thee according to the Idols of thine heart. Children go to Fayrs for babies,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:172730:136"/>and rattles, but men go for ſome ſerviceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, for the ſupply of their own, and their Relations neceſſities. Though fooliſh men go to Church to quarrel with the Perſon teaching, or to admire at ſome fine cadencies or alluſions in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught; do thou go to the word for the releif of thy ſpiritual wants; <hi>As a new born babe defire the ſincere milk of the word, that thou mayſt grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. Here is a good end of a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to gaze upon the people or Paſtor, but to grow by his Preaching. Some men go to Gardens to gather Gilly-flowers or Roſes, meerly to ſmell to them, or look on them and in a ſhort time throw them away, when a good houſe-wife goeth to her garden for a better end; ſhe gathereth them to make a precious conſerve or ſyrrup of them, which ſhe keeps conſtantly by her to comfort her in a time of ſickneſs. Though too many go to a Sermon, meerly to look on the gaudineſs of its dreſs, or to ſente the wit and fancy of the preacher, which ſight and ſente are quickly gone; do thou gather thoſe flowers which grow in <hi>Eden, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Lord,</hi> that thou mayſt by faith make ſuch a cordial of them as may be ever ready at hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive thy ſpirit in each fainting fit, whether of death, or any civil or ſpiritual danger, whilſt thou liveſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If thou would prepare thy ſelf to hear or read the word rightly, <hi>leave thy Worldly thoughts behind thee.</hi> It is written of <hi>Bernard,</hi> that when he came to the Church-door he would ſay; <hi>Stay there all my earthly thoughts</hi> Say to the cares of this life (when thou art about reading or hearing) as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:172730:137"/>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Servant; <hi>Abide you here and I will go yonder and Worſhip,</hi> Gen. 22.5. If thou ſhouldſt ſuffer thoſe weeds, they would hinder the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the good ſeed, the word. They are like Theeves never dogging thee at this duty but to do thee a miſchief, either to ſteal thy comforts, or to wound thy conſcience.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſharply reproveth the Jews for turning his Fathers houſe, which ſhould be called <hi>an houſe of prayer,</hi> into a <hi>Den of Theeves;</hi> but how did they do this? <hi>By buying and ſelling, and changing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Temple</hi> If thou Reader ſhouldſt in thine heart be buying in thy proviſion, or ſelling out thy commodities, or hankering after thine hoards and heaps of Corn, or Wares, or Money, when thou art in Gods Houſe, thou turneſt the <hi>Houſe of prayer into a Den of Theeves;</hi> therefore thy beſt way is to keep them out, and if they come in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (as Chriſt did) to whip them out.</p>
               <p>When men hear with their Harveſt ears (medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and muſing on their flocks, or ſhops, or fields) no wonder if the word be ineffectual to them. If the wits of men be a wool-gathering, the Word of God will be like water ſpilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Some Garden Seeds are mingled with Aſhes when they are ſown, and thereby they ſpring up the better; but this Seed muſt not be mixt with Duſt and Aſhes; if it be, it will not ſpring up at all.</p>
               <p>It is reported of one of Englands Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers (ſome ſay <hi>Cecil,</hi> others ſay <hi>Burleigh</hi>) that though by reaſon of his Office he was crouded with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:172730:137"/>buſineſs all day, yet when he was going to reſt at Night, he would throw off his Gown and ſay, <hi>Lie there Lord Treaſurer;</hi> What he did going to Bed, we muſt do when we go to this heavenly Banquet; though the concernments of our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and callings throng us at other times, yet when we go to hear or read the uncomparable word, we muſt lay them by, with <hi>Lye here all my thoughts of this lower beggerly World.</hi> Thus I have diſpatched the firſt particular, <hi>Preparation for the Word.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>SEcondly, I come now to the ſecond, which is <hi>thy carriage at the word;</hi> in reference to which I ſhall commend to thee theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When thou art hearing or reading, <hi>ſet thy ſelf ſeriouſly as in the preſence of God.</hi> God ſetteth before thee in his word, and offereth to thee life or death, bleſſing or curſing, his infinite favour or fury, Heaven or Hell; and friend, are theſe things to be jeſted with? Imitate <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his carriage, when he was to hear <hi>Peter; We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God</hi> Act. 10.33. The piety of this Centurion appeareth in the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>motive</hi> of his hearing; he came not to hear men, but God; to <hi>hear all things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God,</hi> 2. In the <hi>gracious</hi> manner of his hearing; he doth not ſay, we are all here preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, but we are <hi>all here preſent before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:172730:138"/>
               <p>When the heart is awed with the apprehenſion of a Divine preſence, the iron gates of the ears will fly open of their own accord, and give the Word a free paſſage. The Creature dares not but hearken diligently to the ſpeech of that God, on whoſe breath depends his life and death, when he ſeeth him immediately before his eyes: <hi>I can ſpeak it by experience,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eraſmus, that there is little good to be got by the Scriptures, if a man read or hear it curſorily and careleſly; but if a man do it out of conſcience, and as in Gods preſence, he ſhall finde ſuch an efficacy in it, as is not to be found in any other Book.</hi> This ſetting thy ſelf ſeriouſly, as in Gods preſence, is like the Maſters eye to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which will make him ply his work whether he would or not; or rather like the fire to the Smiths bar of iron, which doth ſo mollifie it, that he ſtriking whilſt it is hot, may beat it into what form and mould he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>This temper of ſoul in the <hi>Theſſalonicans</hi> was ſo great a favour, that <hi>Paul</hi> thought he could never praiſe the Author of it ſufficiently: <hi>For this cauſe thank we God without ceaſing, that when ye heard the word of God, ye heard it not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.13. The Apoſtle knew his children could not but thrive, when they received their meat in ſuch a manner <hi>as the Word of God.</hi> It is the ſpeech of <hi>Seniclaeus</hi> concerning <hi>Diarius</hi> the Martyr, <hi>Methought when I heard him ſpeak, I heard the Holy Ghoſt himſelf preaching to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly the want of this, is one main cauſe why
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:172730:138"/>the Word of God doth ſo little good. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is very diligent at duties: he is every Lords Day the firſt at Church: <hi>The Children of God never gather together, but Satan is amongſt them.</hi> His great deſign is, to render this Engine of the Word fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whereby the Strong-holds of his Kingdom have been battered and broken down. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Jaylor will ſometimes let his priſoners have their hands and feet at liberty, ſo long as the doors of the Priſon are barred and bolted, that they cannot run away; So he will let thee have thy hand at liberty for ſome acts of charity, and thy feet at liberty to walk in ſome path of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo long as he can but have the doors of thine ear and heart lockt faſt, that thou canſt not get from him: He knoweth Chriſt waiteth at the outward door of the ear, that he might thereby come to the inward door of thy heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee a poor Captive out of his hands: For this cauſe, if it be poſſible, he will keep the ſtreet door ſhut, he will hinder thee from hearing as in Gods preſence, he will finde thee other work to do then to hear; it may be he will get thee to play and toy, as he doth many great ones; or if not, to be talking to thy pew-fellows, or to be reading (poſſibly ſomewhat finful, at leaſt ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable) or to have thy heart in thine own houſe, whileſt thy body is in Gods houſe; or as a childe, though thou art at thy book, he will make thee look off, if but a Butter-fly come by; he will ſet thee about ſome buſineſs or other, unleſs thou art ſerious as in Gods ſight, that thou ſhalt never have ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:172730:139"/>much leiſure as to hear, even when thou art in the Church.</p>
               <p>It is reported of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>France,</hi> that in a ſolemn Proceſſion at <hi>Paris,</hi> hecould not be without his Jeſter; who walking between the King and the Cardinal, made mirth to them both; in the mean time there was brave devotion. Alas, they that hear in jeſt, will finde Hell to be hot in earneſt: Were not men Indians and Infidels in Engliſh habits; did they but believe the invaluable worth of their ſouls, the conſequence and weight of their unchangeable eſtates; what a ſearching, trying time the hour of death will be; and what dreadful, terrible things will be ſeen at the day of Judgement; Good Lord, how would they hear! The Miniſter need not call to them to attend to the Word of God, they would of themſelves give it their ears, and mindes, and hearts, and think all too little for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Apply the Word to thine own ſoul:</hi> The Word is a ſalve of ſoveraign vertue. Some talk of the Weapon-ſalve, that it heals at a diſtance; but the Word will not; it muſt be applied to the ſore, or it will never cure. The Word is ſeed, preaching is the ſowing of this ſoed; application of it to thy heart, is the harrowing of this ſeed into the earth: If the ſeed be thrown on the ground, and not harrowed in, we can expect no harveſt.</p>
               <p>A good hearer is ſaid to eat the Word: <hi>Thy words were found by me, and I did eat them,</hi> Jer. 15.16. <hi>Eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled,</hi> Prov. 9.5. It is not the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:172730:139"/>bread in the cupboard of the Bible, or on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Sermon, which will nouriſh thy ſoul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by application of it to thy ſelf, eaten and taken down into thy ſtomack: The glaſs of wine in thine hand, will not make thy heart glad; the precious promiſes in thine ears will not rejoyce thee, they muſt by application be drunk down, then they will refreſh and comfort thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Faith is both the mouth to receive in, and the ſtomack to digeſt this ſpiritual food. It is worthy thy obſervation, how frequently the Holy Ghoſt attributeth the famous effects, and heroick acts of the Word, to this Commander in chief, under whoſe couragious and wiſe conduct it warreth. The Word fighteth boldly, and worketh miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly under Faiths banner: <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God to ſalvation to them that believe,</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. ſo alſo 2 Tim. 3.15. Application is the life both of preaching and hearing.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Threatnings and Curſes</hi> of the Law are preached, faith is to them as the powder to the bullet, cauſing them to make grievous havock, and to do great execution upon the luſts of a man. Faith turneth thoſe ſtones, as I may ſpeak, into bread, and helpeth the Chriſtian (like <hi>Sampſon</hi>) to <hi>fetch meat out of the eater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Precepts and Commands</hi> of the Law are preached, Faith is the eye to ſee the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, and the Excellency of them, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:172730:140"/>Faith is the hand to put them into practice.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Promiſes and Comforts</hi> of the Goſpel are preached, Faith is to them as Induction to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it gives him actual poſſeſſion of them, it makes them his own. <hi>Faith</hi> in the Threatnings, cauſeth Humiliation; <hi>Faith</hi> in the Precepts cauſeth Subjection; and <hi>Faith</hi> in the Promiſes worketh Conſolation.</p>
               <p>If at any time thou goeſt from hearing dead and undone, thou mayeſt ſay to Faith, as <hi>Martha</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>If thou hadſt been here, my ſoul had not dyed.</hi> The unbeliever, like a man in a ſwoon, ſhuts his mouth againſt thoſe life-recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cordials which are before him in the Goſpel. Other ſins wound the ſoul, but Unbelief, like <hi>Joab,</hi> ſtrikes under the fifth rib, and kills out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p>Unbelief ſpoileth all. An Unbeliever is dead, he cannot hear Chriſt in his Word; he is blind, he cannot ſee God in the Goſpel; like <hi>Hagar,</hi> though a Fountain be before him, he beholdeth it not. Unbelief makes the Word like rain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Rocks, wholly uſeleſs and fruitleſs. What is ſaid of the Eſſential Word, is true of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Word, <hi>It can do no mighty works, becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> Unbelief is a Bulwark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſin ſecureth it ſelf, againſt all the darts and ſhot which the Word diſchargeth at it. What was the reaſon that the Word was not helpful to the Jews, Heb. 4.2. <hi>The word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> Unbelief was the crack
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:172730:140"/>in the Glaſs, through which this ineſtimable Water of Life did leak out, and ſo was loſt.</p>
               <p>Nay, What made the Word hurtful to them? This leaven of Unbelief ſowred all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. That Rock on which Faith builds an houſe which reacheth up to Heaven, Unbelief ſtumbleth at, and tumbleth the ſoul into Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Word come with <hi>Authority and Power to thy Conſcience:</hi> This is one of the chiefeſt ingredients that goeth to the compoſition of a Preacher, that he ſpeak as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4. By this force wherewith he ſpake, and execution which he did, that incomparable pattern of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>the Captain of our Salvation,</hi> was diſtinguiſhed from the Phariſees, who in diſcharge of this holy Ordinance, onely made falſe fire: <hi>He taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes: And the people were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine,</hi> Matth. 7.2, <hi>ult.</hi> ver. He is the beſt Souldier, who in this Warfare makes bloodieſt work amongſt our ſpiritual Enemies. This is preaching to purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This is alſo the beſt diſpoſition requiſite in a Religious hearer; <hi>For our Goſpel came not to you in word onely, but in power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.15. When the Word of God cometh like a mighty ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winde, rooting up the tall Trees of thy ſins, bringing down high thoughts, overturning all before it; when as fire, it burneth within thee, conſuming thy luſts, and turning thee into its own likneſs, making thee holy, ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: O this is excellent hearing, this is hearing to purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:172730:141"/>
               <p>The word is Preached to many, and not to their profit. They hear the Miniſter as Chickens hear the Hen; the Hen cals to the Chickens to come to her, they lye ſcraping in the duſt, ſtill many times and will not hear her, till the Kite come and devoureth them. So God endeavoureth in his word by his Miniſters to cluck ſinners to himſelf. <hi>Wiſdom cryeth, underſtanding putteth forth her voice.</hi> But they lie ſcratching, and digging in the earth, and will not hear him, till at laſt the Devil comes and deſtroyeth them; but when the word cometh with power, the ſoul heareth it as <hi>Peter</hi> heard the Cock; He goeth out and weepeth bitterly, when he hears of the boundleſs mercy which he hath deſerted, and the matchleſs miſery which he hath deſerved; and the infinite love which he hath abuſed, and the righteous law which he hath tranſgreſſed, he is cut to the heart, he goeth out and weeps bitterly.</p>
               <p>The word is compared to rain <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. now the rain fals upon flints and doth no good; makes no impreſſion. Miniſters drop it on many to as little purpoſe as <hi>Bede</hi> did when he Preached to an heap of ſtones. They ſpend their ſtrength in vain, and labour in vain; nay like many high-ways and low grounds, they are the worſe for theſe ſhowres. But this rain fals on others to much advantage; <hi>My Doctrine ſhall drop as the rain, and my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender graſs, and as the ſhowers on the hearbs.</hi> Deut. 32.2. The fine ſoft ſhowrs of the word, ſoaks into their affections, ſofteneth their hearts, and makes them fruitful in holineſs.</p>

               <p>The Naturaliſts obſerve of the Salamander, that though ſhe live in the fire conſtantly, yet ſhe is never the hotter. How woful is the condition of thouſands who live all their days under the Word of God, in which is kindled the heavenly fire of Gods infinite love in Chriſt to poor ſinners, and the hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of the hideous horrid nature of ſin, yet they are never the hotter! neither warmed with the former, nor ſcorched with the latter; nay though theſe fires are ſometimes by the <hi>workmen who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the word aright,</hi> heated (as I may ſay) ſeven times hotter then ordinary (by diſcovering the freeneſs (without, yea againſt deſert) fullneſs (a known; unknown love) and faſtneſs (whom he loveth he loveth to the end) of this divine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by declaring the uglineſs and loathſomneſs of corruption, in its contrariety to a righteous law, and a gratious Lord; and in its oppoſition to the ſouls happineſs and perfection, that the very Miniſters who take them up, to put them into this fire, are themſelves with the extremity of its heat, turned into a live Coal, or all in a flame of love to the bleſſed God, and hatred againſt his and their enemy, ſin; yet theſe hearers like the three Children are not touched with all this fire, their garments are not ſo much as ſinged, nor the leaſt ſmell of the fire on them. O woful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!</p>
               <p>What little comfort can poor Miniſters take in their lives, when they converſe with ſuch dead carcaſſes, though they cut them with the laws curſe, pierce them to the quick (one would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:172730:142"/>think) with the terrible day of judgment, and the unquenchable fire, yet they ail nothing, feel nothing, and complain not at all.</p>
               <p>Reader, when thou art hearing, let thy care be, that thy ſoul may be changed into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Scripture, that the word may come with power. When the threatnings are ſhot off, do thou fall down before them with fear: <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy righteous judgements;</hi> When God thundred, <hi>Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> heart trembled. When thou vieweſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and patterns in the word, labour to reſemble them; It is ſaid of the <hi>Earl Elzearus,</hi> one much given to paſſion, that he was cured by reading and hearing of Chriſts patience.</p>
               <p>When the glad tidings of peace are Preached, let thine heart leap with hope. O let the nearer approach of the ſun call forth, and ripen thy fruits of righteouſneſs. When the law comes like a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive eating out thy feſtered fleſh and corruption; when the Goſpel is like a lenitive both refreſhing and refining thee, then they come with power; when the threatnings like wine ſearch the wound, and the promiſes like Oyl heal it, then itcometh with authority and majeſty. If ſearch be made by a reproof for thy beloved ſin, do not like <hi>Rachel</hi> hide it, neither do thou fret when thy ſore is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but hold thine arme forth to that knife which ſhould prick thy vein, and let out thy bad blood. Be not angry when a Prophet ſmites thee in the Name of the Lord; Beleive it, he that hates thy ſins moſt, loveth thee beſt. If thou favour thy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:172730:142"/>luſts ſo much as to keep them ſafe from the <hi>Sword of the ſpirit,</hi> it will prove like <hi>Jorams</hi> reſpect to <hi>Jehu,</hi> thine own deſtruction. Their hearts ſurely were very rugged, which cryed out <hi>Propheſie unto us ſmooth things:</hi> Thoſe feet are very ſore or gouty which cannot go but in downy, moſſie walks, where the ground yeilds to them.

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the Chriſtians duty after Hearing.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THirdly, I proceed now to the third thing, which is, <hi>Thy behaviour after Hearing or Reading;</hi> and I muſt tell thee, that it concerneth thee now to be very watchful; for many Birds wait to peck up the corn, as ſoon as the Husbandman hath ſowed it. Our Saviour telleth us, <hi>He that received ſeed among thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this World, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choak the Word, and he becometh unfruitful,</hi> Mat. 13.32. As High-way men watch the honeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman, as he cometh from the Fair, where he hath ſold his Cattel, and filled his purſe, and then ſet upon him, and rob him: So do the cares of the world dog the honeſt Chriſtian, as he cometh from the Word, where he got ſome Spiritual treaſure, and then fall upon him to plunder him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Satan is ſo ſubtle, that he will be ſure to haunt the ſoul after reading or Hearing the Word: <hi>When any one heareth the Word, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his heart,</hi> Mat. 13.19. The ſeaſon <hi>(then)</hi> is worthy our obſervation: When the Chriſtian hath made a good meal, then the Devil tryeth all his wiles and tricks to make him vomit it up again. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants when they carry full cups of wine in the midſt of unlucky boys, muſt be wary and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or they will ſpill it. Some people take phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and though it doth them ſome good at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:172730:143"/>yet all is quickly marr'd by their neglect of thoſe rules which ſhould be obſerved afterwards: The Word (poſſibly) when thou heardſt it, made ſome work among thy affections; the beauty of Chriſts perſon was diſplayed before thine eyes, and thy heart began to fall in love with thy Saviour; the extremity of his paſſion was deſcribed to thee, and thine heart began to loath the cauſe thereof, thy ſins: Well now then, thy conſcience is a little warmed and awakened, and the pores of thy ſoul opened; ſhouldſt thou go into the cold preſently, all would come to nothing. If water be taken from the fire, when it is a little warm, it cooleth quickly; he that would have it boil, muſt rather encreaſe the fire.</p>
               <p>There are two things which God requireth of thee after hearing and reading the Word, namely, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer; Petition</hi> for a bleſſing upon the Word, and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for the bleſſing of the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petition for a bleſsing upon the Word:</hi> After the ſeed is ſown, the influence of Heaven muſt cauſe it to ſpring up and ripen, or otherwiſe there will be no harveſt. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, <hi>but God muſt give the encreaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preacheth, thou heareſt, but it is the Lord who teacheth to profit. Thou mayeſt, like <hi>Mary,</hi> have Chriſt before thee in a Sermon, and yet not know him, till he diſcover himſelf to thee. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> could <hi>read</hi> of Chriſt in the Prophet, but could not reach Chriſt till God came to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. There is a twofold light requiſite to a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:172730:144"/>viſion, light in the eye, and light in the air, the former cannot (as we experience in the night) do it without the latter. There is alſo a twofold light neceſſary to Spiritual ſight; beſide the light of underſtanding which is in a man, there muſt be Illumination from the Spirit of God, or there will be no beholding the Lord in the glaſs of the Word.</p>
               <p>When the Diſciples had heard Chriſts Doctrine, they were not able to underſtand or profit by his preaching; and therefore they cry to him, <hi>Lord open to us this parable.</hi> When thou haſt read or heard the Word, go to God, and ſay, <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes; Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart. Make me to go in the path of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Encline my heart unto thy Teſtimonies, and not unto covetouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 119.33. to 37. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat God to write his Law on the fleſhly tables of thine heart. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves, bodily bread in the Cupboard may be eaten of Mice, or moulder and waſte; but when it is taken down into the body, it is free from ſuch danger: If God enable thee to take thy ſoul-food down into thine heart, it is ſafe from all hazards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> Conſider what a diſtinguiſhing mercy, what a precious treaſure the Word of God is; how without it thou hadſt for ever been both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and unhappy; how by it thou mayſt eternally be both gracious and glorious; and without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou wilt finde cauſe to bleſs the giver for ſuch a rare and profitable gift. The Apoſtle ranketh
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:172730:144"/>this favour amongſt the bleſſings of the higheſt form: <hi>What advantage hath the Jew? or what profit is there of Circumciſion? Much every way; chiefly that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt mentioning this differencing-Mercy, concludeth it with, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 147.2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The light of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> is of ſuch concernment to men, that without them the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the old Creation would be buried in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore the children of God have given the <hi>Moſt High</hi> the credit of thoſe greater and leſſer Candles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.7, 8, 9. nay, they have ſeen eternal love by thoſe luminaries. The light of Gods Law and Word is of infinitely more worth; for by it the glory and beauty of the new Creation, and that curious piece of mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſeen and known: What honor then doth God deſerve for this favour.</p>

                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was at great coſt and charge to have the Law of the <hi>Jews</hi> tranſlated by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> into <hi>Greek.</hi>

               <p>Didſt thou but know the miſery of thoſe places and perſons who want the Word, ſurely thy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172730:145"/>heart could not but be affected with thy mercy in the enjoyment of the word. It is ſometimes deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Famine; I will ſend a famine, not of bread and water, but of hearing the Word of the Lord,</hi> Amos 4. How dreadful are the concomitants and conſequents of <hi>Famine!</hi> what ſhrivel'd cheeks, hollow eyes, pale viſages, fainting hearts, and trembling limbs, have men in a famine! they ſeem rather like walking Ghoſts, and moving carcaſſes, then living creartures. <hi>The tongue of the ſucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth, for thirſt; the young child asketh bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. Their viſage is blacker then a coal, they are not known in the ſtreets, their skin cleaveth to their bones, it is withered, it is become like a ſtick. The hands of the pitiful Women, have ſodden their own children, they were their meat in the deſtruction of the daughter of my people,</hi> Lam. 4.4, 8, 10. Theſe (friend) are the woful fruits of a bodily famine, but a ſoul famine is the ſorer famine. How many ſtarve for want of the bread of life! Thou ſitteſt (it may be) at a full Table; but couldſt thou conceive what millions famiſh for lack of this ſpiritual food, thou wouldſt pray to God earneſtly to pity ſuch places, and praiſe him hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for providing ſo plentifully for thee. Their miſery is ſometimes ſet forth by <hi>darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death;</hi> Darkneſs is dreadful though but external. Twas one of the greateſt plagues which befel the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> would curſe his day with a witneſs, what is his wiſh? <hi>Let darkneſs and the ſhadow of death ſtain it, let a cloud dwell
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172730:145"/>upon it, let the blackneſs of the day terrifie it.</hi> Job 4.4. It was ſad when <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions ſaw neither Sun nor Stars in many days; but O how ſad is it when men ſee not the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſneſs ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Heavens of the Goſpel all their days! Such may enjoy the <hi>light of Gods providence,</hi> but they enjoy not the <hi>light of his countenance.</hi> How can they work that want the light of the word to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them? or how can they walk? ſurely they that walk in the dark ſtumble, <hi>(the dark corners of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty)</hi> and fall even into Hell. Where no viſion is, the people periſh. O Reader, what infinite cauſe haſt thou to bleſs the Lord, that thou art not in their condition! If thou haſt any compaſſion for the poor, dark, dead ſouls be inſtant with the Lord; pray, <hi>O ſend out thy light and thy truth, that thy ways may be known upon earth, and thy ſaving health unto all Generations.</hi> If thou haſt any affection to thy own ſoul, praiſe God for his Law; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord who hath ſhown us light. Procopius</hi> reporteth that nigh to the Pole where the night endureth for many Months together, the Inhabitants in the end of their long night, get up to the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſtriving who ſhall have the firſt ſight of the Sun, and as ſoon as they ſee it, they embace and hug each other, crying out, <hi>Ecce, Sol apparet; Behold, Lo, the Sun, the Sun appeareth.</hi> This poor Iſland had a long night of darkneſs, when the people in it ſerved dumb Idols and Devils; bleſſed for ever be the unſearchable goodneſs of God, the Sun of the Goſpel hath appeared amongſt us.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:172730:146"/>Nay as its ſaid of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> it may be ſaid of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> The Sun always ſhines on it. What ſhall we render to the Lord for this benefit.</p>
               <p>On the town houſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> is writen upon a Marble Table, in letters of gold, <hi>Poſt tenebraſs Lux. After darkneſs light.</hi> In remembrance of, and thankfulneſs for their deliverance from the pride, power, tyranny, and abominations of the Pope, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1535. I doubt not but we in theſe parts of the World, have as much cauſe to ſet up a Monument of praiſe and thanks to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, for beſtowing upon us the light of his glorious Goſpel, and freeing us from the power of that man of pride, who exalteth himſelf above all that is called God.</p>
               <p>Reader, Is it not a priviledge for thee, to ſit by the fire of the word, when many poor ſouls are freezing in the cold! for thee to walk in the light of the word, when many ſit in darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death! for thee to be clothed out of the rich Wardrobe of the word, when many have their nakedneſs appearing to their eternal ſhame! nay what an advantage haſt thou, that when thouſands and millions, have none to give them bread, but ſtarve and famiſh, thou haſt a Table fairly ſpread, and fully furniſhed with all ſorts of food, both for neceſſity and delight! yea, and if ſickneſs hinder thee from coming down to Dine or Sup with thy brethren; and ſiſters, upon that day of exceedings, the Lords day, thy God is ſo tender of thee, that he ſendeth thee ſomewhat up to thy chamber (alloweth thee his Bible and bleſſing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:172730:146"/>at home) for thy nouriſhment and comfort; <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Practice;</hi> when the Preacher hath done in the Pulpit, the Hearer muſt begin in his practice; He heareth a Sermon beſt who practiſeth it moſt, what one ſaith of <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. I may ſay of the whole Scriptures, They are <hi>verba vivenda, non legenda, words to be loved, more then to be read or heard.</hi> A Chriſtians life ſhould be a legible comment on Gods Law. The ſtrokes in Muſick muſt anſwer to the notes and rules ſet down in the Leſſon.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that the blood was to be ſprinkled on <hi>Aarons</hi> right ear, right thumb, and great toe of his right foot, Exod. 29.20. the firſt did note his right hearing the Word, the ſecond and third his working according to it, and walking in it. The doing, not the hearing or reading Chriſtian, goeth away with the bleſſing; <hi>And he ſaid, yea rather, bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it,</hi> Luke 11.28. The occaſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is confiderable; one of Chriſts hearers, having taſted, was ſo taken with the luſciouſneſs of his Doctrine, that ſhe could not before all the company forbear commending the tree for the fruits ſake, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked; Yea rather</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it;</hi> In which words he doth not deny her aſſertion, but her inference, or the foundation of it. <hi>Mary</hi> though happy, yet was not ſo happy in bearing the eſſential, as in keeping the Written
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:172730:147"/>Word of God. She was rather bleſſed in having Chriſt formed in her, then in having him formed of her; It was her greater honour and happineſs to be a member of Chriſt, then to be the Mother of Chriſt. The Porter is not ſo rich by carrying a bag of Gold, as the Merchant that oweth it. The Chriſtian onely that keepeth the word of Chriſt, is truely related to Chriſt the Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported of the Nobles of <hi>Polonia,</hi> that when the Goſpel is read, they lay their hands upon their Swords, and begin to draw them; intimating thereby that they will defend it with the hazard of their lives: Saints muſt be ready to die for the Goſpel, but a Chriſtian may defend it as truely by an holy life, as by a bloody death. A ſcandalous converſation, is an offence to Religion, and openeth the mouths of its enemies; but as fire is a good defence to a man in a Wilderneſs, againſt the fury of ravenous beaſts, ſo the heat of grace flaming, and the light of holineſs ſhining in the lives of profeſſors, defendeth the word againſt its oppoſers. A Sermon practiced, is a Sermon in print, and by it the hearer teacheth all the Week long.</p>
               <p>The Romans were commended for <hi>obeying from the heart,

In the Original it is <hi>whereunto they were delivered;</hi> A good hearer, as I ſaid before, is one that eats the word; now as meat eaten becomes one with the body, and takes the ſame form with it, the body and meat are ſo much the ſame, that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:172730:147"/>they are one, and you cannot know them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: So the Word is well heard, when it becomes one with the Chriſtian, when they are both of the ſame form; the hearer is delivered up into the likeneſs and form of the Scripture; the Word of God may be read in every leaf, in every line of the volume of his life.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour deſcribing good hearers, tells us, they are ſuch as bring forth fruit, <hi>ſome thirty, ſome ſixty, ſome an hundred fold,</hi> Mat. 13.23. And elſewhere he compares the obedient hearer, to the man who built his houſe upon a Rock, which ſtood firm and immoveable in the midſt of all winds, waves, and weather; and the man that heareth and doth not practice, to him who built upon the ſands, which houſe quickly fell, when the winds blew, and the waves beat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. latter end. His meaning and intention (Reader) was to quicken thee and me to minde ſubjection to the Word, without which we muſt periſh. Suppoſe thou art never ſo great an hearer, yet if not a doer, thou deceiveſt thine own ſoul: Alas, what will become of the frequent hearer, when the <hi>non,</hi> or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent doer ſhall be thrown to hell!</p>
               <p>I have read a ſtory of two men, who walking together, found a young Tree laden with fruit, they both gathered, and ſatisfied themſelves at preſent: One of them took all the remaining fruit; and carried it away with him; the other took the tree, and planted it in his own ground, where it proſpered, and brought forth fruit every year; ſo that though the former had more at preſent, yet
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:172730:148"/>this had ſome when he had none: They who hear the Word, and have large memories, and nothing elſe, may carry away moſt of the Word at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet he that (poſſibly) can remember little, who carrieth away the tree, plants the Word in his heart, and obeys it in his life, ſhall have fruit when the other hath none: The practical memory, is the greateſt mercy.</p>
               <p>It is reported of a good man, that coming from a Lecture, and being demanded, Whether all were done, he ſhould fetch a deep ſigh, and ſay, <hi>All is ſaid, but all is not done.</hi>

They are deſcribed by their <hi>act;</hi> they lay the word up, they <hi>remember his Commandments;</hi> and by their <hi>end,</hi> to lay the word out in their lives, <hi>to do them.</hi> A good husband having received a bag of money, locketh it up ſafe, that none may rob him of it, and as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, fetcheth it down, and layeth it out, ſome for food, ſome for cloathes, ſome for rent, ſome for ſervants wages, ſome for this, ſome for that, as his neceſſities require: So (Friend) do thou lay up the precious Treaſure of the word ſafe in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:172730:148"/>the Cabinet of thine heart, and bring it out as thy occaſions call for it in thy life: <hi>Art thou in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, fetch out the Promiſes for thy comfort;</hi> broach that ſtrong liquor, which was purpoſely tunned up for thee againſt a groaning hour: <hi>This is my comfort in mine affliction, for thy word hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me,</hi> Pſal. 119.15. <hi>Art thou in proſperity, bring forth the precepts for thy carriage:</hi> Look to that Card and Compaſs by which thou mayeſt ſail eavenly and trim, notwithſtanding thoſe high winds, and ſwelling waters: <hi>Thy Word is a light to my feet, and a lamp to my paths,</hi> Pſal. 119.4. <hi>Wouldſt thou reſiſt and conquer Satans Temptations?</hi> The word is a Shield, which (as they ſay of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> Armour) is full proof againſt all thruſts and darts: <hi>By the words of thy mouth, I have kept my ſelf from the pathes of the deſtroyer,</hi> Pſal. 17.4.

               </head>
               <p>VVHen God had cauſed his everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to fall in labour, and had delivered it by giving the world a being; and upon infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation had formed <hi>Man</hi> to be his <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> over all the works of his hands, he <hi>embarqued</hi> him (with all abilities needful for ſuch a voyage) in the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Works. Adam</hi> ſet forth fully furniſhed with skill, and richly fraught with all the Fortunes, Hopes and Happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:172730:151"/>but he had ſcarce <hi>lanched</hi> out of ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan, who knew very well the worth of the prize (envying man the <hi>Haven</hi> of bliſs to which he was ſailing, and envying God (who was the owner) the honor of ſuch of a <hi>venture</hi>) raiſed a <hi>ſtorm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> through the unfaithfulneſs of <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>Pilot,</hi> ran upon a <hi>Rock,</hi> and miſcarried. O what a joyful ſpectacle was that to Satan! What a doleful ſight to <hi>Adam!</hi> to behold himſelf and all his poſterity, ſinking into the boundleſs, bottomleſs Ocean of deſtruction and miſery, through his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and treachery: When lo, on a ſudden the Glorious God, out of the ſuperabundant riches of his mercy (reſolving that the Devil ſhould never rob him of the honor of that manifold <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and Almighty <hi>Power</hi> which had been manifeſted in the work of Creation) did provide and caſt out the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> a plank ſufficient for his poor ſhipwrackt Creature, to ſwim ſafe to ſhore on.</p>
               <p>As all the Rivers meet in the <hi>Sea,</hi> and all the lines in the <hi>Centre;</hi> ſo do all the comforts of Mankind meet in this <hi>Covenant.</hi> The whole Scripture is <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk,</hi> but this <hi>Covenant</hi> is the <hi>Cream</hi> of it: All our mercies are contained in it, all our hopes are ſuſtained by it, and our Heaven is at laſt attained through it.</p>
               <p>The bleſſed God doth not onely enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of mercy, but out of compaſſion to our infirmities, hath been pleaſed to confirm it by his hand and ſeal: By his <hi>hand,</hi> in his word; by his <hi>ſeals,</hi> by the <hi>privy-ſeal</hi> of his Spirit, and by the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:172730:152"/>
                  <hi>broad-ſeals</hi> of the Sacraments, that by theſe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.18.</p>
               <p>The Lords Supper is a ſign and ſeal of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith, or the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>When the bleſſed Saviour was taking a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful farwel of an ungrateful world, as a <hi>lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of his ſufferings for his,</hi> and as an <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable evidence of his love to his,</hi> he inſtituted this Supper: 1. <hi>As a lively reſemblance of his paſſion for his people.</hi> A crucified Chriſt is the ſum of the Law, and the ſubſtance of the Goſpel; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him is no leſs worth then Eternal life. Now as he was crucified by the Jews and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers actually, and by unbelieving Gentiles who live amongſt us interpretatively; ſo he is crucified in the Goſpel declaratively, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repreſentatively. <hi>This Cup,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is the new Teſtament in my blood,</hi> 1 Corinth. 11.25. The Old Teſtament was ſprinkled with the blood of Beaſts, but the New Teſtament with the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15, 19. This precious blood, which was the coſtly price of mans <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> which is the onely path to Eternal <hi>Salvation;</hi> which was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> believed by the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> ſhadowed in the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and witneſſed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is drunk, received, ſignified and ſealed in the <hi>Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:172730:152"/>
               <p>Chriſt inſtituted this ordinance alſo to be a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>evidence of his affection to his. The ſame night that he was betrayed he took bread.</hi> The deareſt Jeſus, kept his beſt wine till the laſt. He knew his Diſciples would be full of ſorrow for his departure; he therefore provided his ſtrongeſt cordial againſt their ſaddeſt fainting fits. After the <hi>Paſſover</hi> he took bread and inſtituted the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> After <hi>Supper</hi> then comes the <hi>Banquet,</hi> the <hi>Sweet-meats.</hi> At the Lords Table Chriſt kiſſeth his Spouſe with the ſweeteſt kiſſes of his lips, and raviſheth her heart with his warmeſt love. In other Ordinances he <hi>Wooeth</hi> her; in this he <hi>Marrieth</hi> her. In other Ordinances ſhe hath from him the ſalutes of a <hi>loving friend;</hi> but in this the embraces of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; Other duties are pleaſant and wholſom <hi>food,</hi> but this is the coſtly delightful feaſt. In this Chriſt bringeth his beloved <hi>into his Banqueting houſe,</hi> (a ſtore-houſe of all ſweet delights, of variety of delicacies) <hi>and his Banner over her is love,</hi> Cant. 2.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A certain man made a great Supper,</hi> Luk. 14.16. I may truely ſay ſo of the Sacrament. This is a <hi>great Supper,</hi> in regard of its <hi>Author:</hi> The great God is Maſter of the feaſt. He gave his own Son for the life of the World. 2. In regard of the matter of it, which is the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt; Men ſet bread and wine on the Table; but Chriſt ſetteth his own body and blood there. In this ordinance we eat not onely <hi>(Panem Domini, ſed panem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num) The bread of the Lord, but the bread which is the Lord. The gods</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are come down in the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:172730:153"/>likeneſs of man;</hi> behold here God the Son cometh down in the likeneſs of bread and wine; he himſelf is eat and drunk by faith. Is not this a rare banquet? 3. In regard of the great price of it. Banquets are coſtly; but O what did this feaſt coſt? Beaſts are ſlain before they can be food for our bodies; but, Lo, here the Lord of life was put to death, that he might be food for our ſtarving ſouls. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> diſſolved a pearl worth 50000. <hi>l.</hi> in Vinegar, and drunk it up at a draught; but as coſtly as her liquor was, it was much worſe then puddle water, in compariſon of the precious blood of Chriſt, which the beleiver drinketh at this great Supper. 4. In regard of its great effects; It ſealeth <hi>pardon, peace,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to the Saint; it conveyeth the Image and love of God, nay God himſelf into the ſoul; Through the golden pipe of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is conveyed the golden Oyl of divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There is <hi>Manna</hi> indeed in this pot. Well may it be called a great Supper. The <hi>Elements</hi> are of ſmall value, but the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is of infinite worth. A conveyance of land fairly written in Parchment with wax faſtened to it, is of little price, but when it is ſigned, ſealed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the uſe of a perſon, it may be worth much, it may convey thouſands: A little bread and a ſpoonful or two of wine, are in themſelves of very ſmall value; but when received according to Chriſts inſtitution, and accompanied with his benediction, they will be of unſpeakable value, they will convey thouſands and millions to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:172730:153"/>
               <p>The Lords Supper is indeed like an Elixar, which is ſmall in quantity, but great in value, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, having in it the ſpirits and ſubſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent things; In prayer all the graces are exerciſed, and ſo alſo at the Supper; but not onely all the graces, but moſt of the other Ordinances of God are invited to this feaſt. The Word, Prayer, Singing, do all meet at the Table, and contribute their help, to carry the Chriſtian up to Heaven. I premiſe theſe things Reader, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make thee more wary. The corrupting of the beſt, is worſt of all. Poiſon in Wine is much worſe then in Water; Kings expect that their Children ſhould be reſpected, though their officers be refuſed. <hi>Surely</hi> ſaith God, <hi>They will reverence my Son,</hi> Mat. 21.37. The very work about which he comes, will make him welcome. Though they refuſe my Servants, yet <hi>they will reverence my Son.</hi> The <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> ſay <hi>Sacramentum &amp; articulus mortis aequiparantur; A man muſt be looked upon at the Sacramental board as if he were on a bying bed;</hi> Friend, thou ſhouldſt be as ſerious when thou art going to the Lords Supper, as if thou wert going into the other World.</p>
               <p>He that cometh careleſly, gets nothing from Chriſt; It is one thing to <hi>take the Supper of the Lord,</hi> and another thing to <hi>taſte the Supper of the Lord. Not one of them which were bidden, ſhall taſte of my Supper,</hi> Luk. 14.24. Many croud near a Kings perſon, on ſome days, when he ſheweth himſelf in publique, who never injoy his gracious preſence. Hundreds receive the Elements, but few receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:172730:154"/>
               <p>If a Beaſt did but touch the Mount (when God ſolemnly appeared on it) it was to dye: What then will become of thee, if thou ſhouldſt touch the Table of the Lord with a brutiſh heart? If any did eat of the Paſſoever in his uncleanneſs, he was to be <hi>cut off from Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 12. which ſome interpret of a violent death by the hand of the Magiſtrate; Others, of a cutting off from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Gods people on earth, and their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in Heaven: Surely it is as dangerous to eat the Supper in thy pollution, as the Paſſoever.</p>
               <p>It is evil to <hi>dally</hi> with the <hi>Jealous God</hi> in any duty; but worſt of all in this, where the <hi>great affection</hi> of the Father in giving his Son, and the <hi>grievous Paſſions</hi> of Chriſt (to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for ſin) the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> things which mans heart can conceive, are repreſented. <hi>Melancthon</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a ſtory of a <hi>Tragedy</hi> which was acted of the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt (but it proved a Tragedy indeed at laſt; for) he that acted Chriſts part on the Croſs, being wounded to death (by one that ſhould have thruſt his ſword through a bladder of blood) fell down, and with his fall killed one acting a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans part, and lamenting under the Croſs: His brother who was firſt ſlain, ſlew the murtherer, for which himſelf was hanged by order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh of an ancient woman, who had denied the Faith, and yet ventured to this Heavenly Feaſt; but it proved her bane; for as ſoon as ſhe had received the Elements, ſhe fell down dead. O 'tis ſad jeſting with the Sufferings and Ordinances of Chriſt! Friend, let others wo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172730:154"/>be thy <hi>warning:</hi> Take example by others, leſt God make thee an example to others.</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay down two motives to quicken thee to a ſerious preparation for this Ordinance:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider Chriſts <hi>diligent inſpection:</hi> The Lord Jeſus will take ſpecial notice what reſpect thou haſt for his Body and Blood: <hi>And when the King came in to ſee his gueſts, he ſaw there a man which had not on a Wedding-garment,</hi> Mat. 22.11, 12, 13. Jeſus Chriſt obſerveth all his wedding gueſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come with the Wedding-garment or no. Though there was but one, yet he could not lie hid, and eſcape in the crowd; the King quickly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
               <p>The King of Saints taketh exact notice, in what manner thou comeſt to his Supper; whether thou examineſt thy Regeneration, and proveſt thy ſelf to be one of the family, before thou offereſt to eat of their food; whether thou carrieſt the <hi>Gold</hi> of thy Graces to the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of the Scripture, and trieſt their truth, before thou tendereſt them to him for <hi>currant coyn.</hi> He obſerveth with what ſenſe of thy miſery thou runneſt for refuge to the ſpring of mercy: He knoweth whether when thou art going to this Heavenly Feaſt, thou haſt the mouth of Faith; with what reſolution againſt ſin for time to come, thou goeſt for pardon of ſins paſt: He ſeeth whether thou goeſt to this Goſpel-Ordinance, in a Goſpel-order; if not, both thy preparation for the Sacrament, and thy carriage at it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, are eye-ſervices to Jeſus Chriſt: How ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore ſhould thou be in them? Wouldſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172730:155"/>thou trample upon the picture of thy dear Friend, or of thy lawful Soveraign, before their faces? Wilt thou tread under foot the infinitely precious blood of the Son of God, as if it were the blood of a Malefactor, or of a Dog, and that while he himſelf ſtandeth by, and looketh on? Canſt thou (Friend) finde in thine heart to offer ſuch an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable affront to thy beſt Friend, and that before his face? Truly, if thou art not faithful in thy preparation for it, thou doſt all this. Think with thy ſelf, <hi>I am now to ſit down at the Table of the Lord, amongſt his own children: I know beforehand that the King will come in to ſee his Gueſts; even that King who is too juſt to be bribed, too great to be ſlighted, too wiſe to be deceived, and too good to be forfeited. O, my ſoul! what ſolemn proviſion wilt thou make for ſo ſacred a preſence? If in any time of thy life thou wouldſt be extraordinarily ſerious, this is the ſeaſon. O let thy preparation be ſuch for this glorious Supper, that the Maſter of the Feaſt may ſee that thou art ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his honor, watchful of his eye, and fearful of his anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the <hi>dreadful condition</hi> of thoſe that receive the Lords Supper unworthily: Their <hi>ſin, They are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord;</hi> Their <hi>ſuffering, They eat and drink their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> 1 Cor. 11.27, 29.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <hi>ſin: They are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord:</hi> The unworthy receiver is a Chriſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. He that tears the Letters, or defaceth the Picture, or clippeth the coyn of a Prince, offereth the indignity to his perſon. The Romans when
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:172730:155"/>they would diſhonor a perſon, would disfigure the ſtatue which was erected to his praiſe. The ſame wickedneſs of heart which carrieth a man out to prophane the Sacrament, would carry him out to kill the Saviour.</p>
               <p>When one ſhoots at another to ſlay him, though he miſs, he is a murderer; the error of the hand doth not wipe out the malice of the heart. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Brethren were guilty concerning their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they did not lay violent hands upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. When <hi>Julian</hi> ſhot darts up to Heaven, his cruelty and rage were as bad, as if he had hit Chriſts body. Beſides, men may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of murther, by approving it after it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. What doth the unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver leſs then juſtifie <hi>Judas</hi> and the Jews in all their treacherous and barbarous carriage towards Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore what thou doſt, when thou goeſt unpreparedly to the Lords Table; <hi>Thou art guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> Simple murther is a <hi>crying</hi> ſin: <hi>The voyce of thy Brothers blood cryeth to me from the earth,</hi> Gen. 4.10. It is one of thoſe ſins which will give God no reſt, till he take vengeance on the actor and author of it, and is therefore called <hi>a crying ſin.</hi> The light of Nature taught the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that Vengeance would not ſuffer a murtherer to live, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. The Scripture acquainteth us, that <hi>no ſatisfaction ſhall be taken for the life of a murtherer; for blood defileth the land,</hi> Numb. 35.31, 36. But the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Superior is a far greater ſin. <hi>Cicero</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:172730:156"/>us, <hi>He that killeth his Father, committeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins in one; he killeth him that begot him, and brought him up; he ſinneth againſt many obligations.</hi> To kill a King is <hi>High-Treaſon: Who can ſtretch his hand againſt the Lords Anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> 1 Sam. 26.9. But what is it to murther the Son of God? no tongue can tell, no pen can write the horrid, hainous nature of Chriſt-murther. He is thy <hi>everlaſting Father.</hi> It made a dumb childe ſpeak to ſee another ſtabbing his Father; and wilt thou imbrue thine own hands in thy Fathers blood? Jeſus Chriſt is thy King, and wilt thou ſtretch forth thy hands againſt thy Head, thy Soveraign? Had <hi>Zimri</hi> peace, who ſlew his Maſter? Nay, Jeſus Chriſt is thy Redeemer; and wilt thou put him to death, who is the Author of thy life? He gave thee thy being; and wouldſt thou deprive him of his being? He is the onely Phyſician that can cure thee; and wilt thou kill him? Once more, Jeſus Chriſt is God, and wilt thou lift up thy hand (I would ſay a thought) againſt the bleſſed God? God deſerveth infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more love then thou canſt poſſibly give; and ſhall thine heart be ſo full of hatred, as to let fly againſt the God of Heaven? Oh! ſay with <hi>David,</hi> (when <hi>Abiſhai</hi> perſwaded him to ſlay <hi>Saul</hi>) <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth my hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords anointed.</hi> When Satan, or thy own heart, would perſwade thee to be ſlight in the examination of thy ſelf, and formal in thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for ſin, that thou mighteſt be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, let Conſcience cry out, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſtretch out my
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:172730:156"/>hand againſt Jeſus Chriſt, the Lords Anointed;</hi> And truly Friend, if after ſuch warning as God gives thee in this head, thou ſhouldſt dare to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, thou wouldſt finde it hereafter to thine unſpeakable hurt: As <hi>Reuben</hi> told his Brethren, when they were in diſtreſs, <hi>Spake I not unto you, ſaying, Do not ſin againſt the child; and ye would not hear? therefore behold his blood is required,</hi> Gen. 42.22. So, if thou now dareſt to approach the Lords Table, in thy ſinful unregenerate eſtate, in thy filth and pollution, when thou comeſt to lie under ſome ſmart rod, or on thy dying bed, or at leaſt in the other World, Conſcience will fly in the face, <hi>Did I not ſpeak unto thee, ſaying, Do not ſin againſt the holy Childe Jeſus, and thou wouldſt not hear? therefore behold his blood is required at thy hands!</hi> O Friend, Friend, what wilt thou do in ſuch an hour! If on him who ſlew <hi>Cain,</hi> venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be taken ſevenfold; what vengeance ſhall be taken on him who ſlayeth Jeſus Chriſt? How dreadful will thy perdition be, if the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour be thine Accuſer, and that blood which alone can procure thy <hi>pardon,</hi> ſhall cry for thine eternal <hi>puniſhment!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O think of it ſeriouſly, Haſt thou never had hard thoughts of the Jews for their cruelty to the Son of God? and wilt thou do worſe thy ſelf! The Jews crucified him but once, but thou by continuing an unworthy receiver, crucifieſt him often: The Jews did it ignorantly; <hi>Had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. but thou <hi>knoweſt him</hi> to be the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:172730:157"/>Son of God, the Saviour of the World: They crucified him in his eſtate of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> but thou in his eſtate of <hi>Exaltation:</hi> They had not not thee for a <hi>Warning,</hi> when they put him to death; but thou haſt them for a <hi>Warning</hi> to thee: They crucified him when he was to riſe again the third day; but thou ſo crucifieſt him, that he might never riſe more, were it in thy power. O take heed what thou doſt, and be not worſe then a Jew.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>ſuffering: He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. Some I know are offended at the tranſlation of the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Damnation; but I ſee little reaſon for it; for Damnation is the end of every ſin, though it be not the end of every ſinner. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Believers indeed; but as it may be truly ſaid of one that drinketh poyſon, Such a man drunk his bane, though by the help of a Phyſician ſuch an Antidote may be given as may prevent the Patients death; ſo it may be truly ſpoken of a Believer who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth unworthily, He eateth and drinketh his own damnation; though, through the Grace and Help of Jeſus Chriſt (no thank to himſelf) he is recovered out of that ſin, and ſaved. <hi>Beza,</hi> and the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation take it in this ſenſe. So the word is taken, <hi>John</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. and in ſeveral other places.</p>
               <p>Now what an argument is here, to diſſwade thee from going raſhly or unpreparedly to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord. That which is a worthy receivers
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:172730:157"/>meat, will be thy poiſon; the ſame red Sea of Chriſts blood, which is ſalvation to others (they paſs ſafely through it into the land of promiſe) will be damnation to thee. King <hi>John,</hi>

               <p>Therefore Reader, take ſome time and pains to commune with thy own heart, before thou goeſt to the Sacrament.

O how doleful is that one word</hi> Damnation! <hi>What a dreadful ſound doth it make in mine ears! What fearful ſighs doth it cauſe in my ſoul! Damnation is no trifling buſineſs.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:172730:158"/>God threateneth it in earneſt. The damned feel it in earneſt, and ſhall I jeſt with it? Surely I were better eat the bread of affliction, and drink the water of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, then eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily. Canſt thou be ſo bloody as to ſtab thy ſelf, and thy Redeemer to the heart with one blow! O my ſoul, beſtir thy ſelf, awake out of ſleep, and do not dally about the concernments of eternal life and death, let thy care and conſcience be ſuch; in fitting thy ſelf for this ſacred Ordinance, that thy Saviour may ſee, thou haſt an high reſpect for his precious blood, and a tender regard to thine own everlaſting good.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, To thy duty <hi>before</hi> the Sacrament; and herein my counſel is, that thou wouldſt prepare thy ſelf ſolemnly for this Ordinance. The Jews had their preparation for their Paſſover, <hi>John</hi> 19.24. <hi>It was the preparation of the Paſſover.</hi> Nay, they took their Lamb the tenth day of the moneth, and did not kill it till the fourteenth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3. (and as ſome of their Writers obſerve, they tied it all the while to their bed poſts) that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim they might prepare themſelves for it. Our Lord Jeſus when he was to eat the Paſſoever, and inſtitute the Supper, would have ſo much as the houſe in which he would do it, prepared before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.15.

               <p>Reader, thy care muſt be to <hi>trim</hi> thy <hi>lamp,</hi> and make ſure of <hi>oyl</hi> in the <hi>veſſel</hi> now thou art going to meet the <hi>Bridegrom. Samuel</hi> ſpake to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Bethlehem, Sanctifie your ſelves, and come to the Sacrifice:</hi> ſo ſay I to thee, Sanctifie thy ſoul, and then come to the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Joſeph</hi> prepared himſelf, by ſhaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and changing his raiment, before he went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> And wilt not thou prepare thy ſelf, by putting thy ſoul into the holieſt poſture thou canſt, when thou art to go in unto the King of Heaven and Earth? He that would make a good meal, even when he is to feaſt at anothers coſt, muſt prepare his ſtomack beforehand by moderate faſting, or exerciſe. God expecteth that the hands be pure, but eſpecially that the heart be prepared: <hi>The good Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) <hi>pardon every one that prepareth his heart, though it be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</hi> 2 Chro. 30.18, 19. the King ſpeaketh of thoſe who came to the Paſſover with ſome ceremonial pollution, yet had moral purity; and his words are to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Lord, though ſeveral of my people have failed, in regard of external purification; let it pleaſe thee to pardon them, if they have minded internal prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Friend, there is no hope of remiſſion, without this heart-preparation: The Devil himſelf would not come into an houſe, till it was <hi>ready ſwept and garniſhed,</hi> Mat. 12. And doſt thou think that Jeſus Chriſt will come into thy heart, while it lieth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:172730:159"/>naſtily and ſluttiſhly, before the filth of ſin be ſwept out, and it be garniſhed with the Graces of his Spirit. Surely that room had need be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hung, with the embroidery of the Spirit, in which the glorious and bleſſed Potentate will ſup and lodge. Where thy expectation is great from a perſon, there thy preparation muſt be great for him. Doſt thou not look like <hi>Herod,</hi> to ſee ſome miracle done by Jeſus, ſome extraordinary thing for thy ſoul? Therefore I ſay to thee, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpake to the Iſraelites, <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves, for to morrow the Lord will do wonders amongſt you,</hi> Joſh. 3.5. O ſanctifie thy ſelf, and to morrow (on the Sacrament-day) the Lord will do wonders for thee; he will feaſt thee at his own Table; he will feed thee with his own fleſh; he will give thee that love, which is better then wine; he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee in his arms, and kiſs thee with the kiſſes of his mouth; he will delight thine eyes with the ſight of his beautiful Perſon; raviſh thine ears, with the ſound of his precious promiſes; and rejoyce thine heart, with the aſſurance of his gracious pardon. O do but ſanctifie thy ſelf, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Lord will do wonders for thee: This preparation conſiſteth in a ſerious examination of thy ſelf, and a ſincere humiliation for thy ſins.</p>
               <p>Thy ſerious examination of thy ſelf, muſt be, Firſt, Of the <hi>Good</hi> in thee. Secondly, Of the <hi>Evil</hi> done by thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo</hi> (and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) <hi>let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. Examine himſelf, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Thy Navel is like a round Goblet which wanteth not liquor, thy belly is like an heap of Wheat, ſet about with Lillies,</hi> Cant 7.2. The words are Chriſts praiſe of his ſpouſe, for her fruitfulneſs in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children forth, and her faith fulneſs in bringing them up. By the <hi>Navel</hi> Expoſitors agree that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is underſtood, by which (as children by the <hi>Navel</hi>) the members of the Church are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, even then when they are ſo feeble that they cannot feed themſelves, but their whole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance is conveyed to them by others. By the belly is meant the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> Now obſerve

Ainſworth</hi> on the words obſerveth, that in thoſe times, they brought their Corn in and ſtackt it up in heaps, ſo that as the belly diſtributeth to every part of the body its proportion of nouriſhment, and as an heap of Wheat ſatisfieth the hunger of, and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtrength to a whole Family, ſo doth the Church by this Sacrament beſtow on all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (through Chriſt) that food which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for health and ſtrength. The perſons which are to eat of this Wheat, <hi>ſet about with lillies;</hi> They muſt be Saints and are compared to Lilies. Firſt, For their innocency, they are Lilly-white.

The graces of beleivers are like ſweet perfumes, and ſented as far as Heaven. The Lords Supper is a Sacrament not of Regeneration, but of ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; When the Prodigal came to himſelf, then the fatted Calf was killed for him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Men muſt have natural life, before they can eat natural meat, and men muſt have ſpiritual life, before they can eat ſpiritual meat. It was an ancient abuſe of the Sacrament, caſt out by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Council, to give it to dead men. The invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not to Enemies but friends, <hi>Eat O friends, drink abundantly O beloved,</hi> Cant. 5.1. The
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:172730:160"/>waters of life is onely for the thirſty, and the bread of life onely for the hungry; the Shew-bread under the Law was to be eaten onely by the Prieſts, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.9. ſo the bread of the Sacrament is to be eaten onely by ſuch as are ſpiritual Prieſts unto God, as Saints are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Reader, examine thy ſelf therefore whether thou art born again or no. Look into the Word of God, and compare thy ſelf with the Characters which are there given of new born Creatures. They are ſometimes deſcribed by their hearts. <hi>God is good to Iſrael, to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> Pſa. 73.1. Their hearts are clean, not with a legal cleanneſs, which denyeth the being of ſin in them; In that ſenſe none can ſay I have made my heart clean (this ſpotleſs robe is reſerved for the Saints wearing in the other World) but with an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical cleanneſs, which denyeth the dominion of ſin over them (this cleanly garment is the Saints ordinary attire in this world.) We call <hi>River-water</hi> clean water, though there be ſome kind of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impurity in it, becauſe it will not (like pond water) mingle with it, and ſuffer the filth to reſt there, but worketh it out, and ſeadeth it forth in its ſcum and froth. Now how is it with thee Friend? Doth ſin reſt quietly in thee? or is it reſiſted by thee? Doſt thou love ſin or loath ſin? Doſt thou count it thy pleaſure or thy poiſon? When the body is dead, Vermine crawl in it without oppoſition. When the ſoul is dead, luſts abound in it and reign without any conſiderable diſturbance. An unclean heart is
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:172730:161"/>quickly overcome by ſin. As when a Chimny is foul, it is apt to be fired by every ſpark that flieth up, whereas when it is clean, though many flye up it remaineth ſafe; ſo when the heart is unclean, Satan can no ſooner throw in his fiery Darts, but preſently it is in a flame; whereas a clean heart is like wet tinder not ſo ſoon burning when he ſtrikes fire. Godly men as they have clean hearts, ſo they have <hi>clean hands, Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>The hand is the inſtrument of action;</hi> by clean hands, the Spirit of God meaneth clean and holy actings.</p>
               <p>Saints are deſcribed by their lives. They walk <hi>after the Spirit.</hi> They order their <hi>converſations aright. Per brachium fit judicium de corde,</hi> was <hi>Galens</hi> rule. Phyſitians feel the pulſe of the Arme, that they may know the ſtate of the vitals; Now how beats the pulſe of thy converſation? accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, judge of the ſoundneſs or ſickneſs of thy conſtitution. Doſt thou walk in reference to thy ſelf <hi>ſoberly,</hi> in reference to others <hi>righteouſly,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God <hi>religiouſly?</hi> Rom. 8.1, 5. Tit. 2.12.</p>
               <p>Thy duty is to examine thy ſelf in particular alſo of thoſe <hi>graces,</hi> which are ſpecially requiſite in a Communicant. Of thy <hi>knowledge to diſcern the Lords body.</hi> There is a competency of knowledge needful if thou wouldſt receive acceptably. Doſt thou know the threefold eſtate of man? His <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Recovery.</hi> What a pure piece he was, how holy when he came out of Gods hands! what a miſerable polluted creature he hath made himſelf by diſobeying God, and hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:172730:161"/>to the Tempter! what a glorious remedy God hath provided to reſtore man to his primitive purity! Doſt thou know God as he diſcovereth himſelf in his works, but eſpecially as he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Glaſs of his word? Doſt thou know Jeſus Chriſt, his two Natures, his three Offices, how he executeth them, both in his eſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and exaltation? Doſt thou know the nature and end of the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>An ignorant perſon can no more diſcern Chriſts body, then a perſon ſtark blind can diſcern the bread. God hath expreſly forbidden lame and blind Sacrifices, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8. The Hypocrits Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is <hi>Lame,</hi> for he halteth in Gods <hi>Way.</hi> The ignorant perſons Sacrifice is blind, for he can give no account of his own work. When the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie was in the head, the Prieſt was to pronounce the party <hi>utterly unclean,</hi> exclude him the Camp, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.44. Do not ſay, though thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet thy heart is good, when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith; <hi>Without knowledge the mind is not good:</hi> Fiſh ſtink firſt in the head, and then the whole body putrifieth.</p>
               <p>Examine thy <hi>Faith.</hi> This grace is thy ſpiritual taſte, without which thou canſt reliſh nothing on the Table. This is the Bucket, and if it be wanting I may ſay to thee as the Woman to Chriſt, <hi>The Well is deep, and thou haſt nothing to draw with.</hi> This is the hand to receive Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. This is as the Armes whereby we imbrace Chriſt. They <hi>embraced the promiſes by faith,</hi> Heb. 11.13. As loving friends that have been a great while aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:172730:162"/>when they meet together, hug and embrace each other in their Arms; ſo the Chriſtian who longeth to ſee Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſes, when at a Sacrament he meeteth him, huggeth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth him in the Arms of faith.</p>
               <p>Examine not ſo much the ſtrength as the truth of thy faith. The wings of a <hi>Dove</hi> may help her to mount up towards Heaven, as well as the wings of an <hi>Eagle.</hi> Try whether thy faith be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. What price doſt thou ſet upon Chriſt? <hi>To them that beleive, Chriſt is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. An unbeleiver (like the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) ſeeth no worth in this golden <hi>Mine,</hi> but preferreth a peice of Glaſs, or a few painted Beads, mean, earthly things before it; but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver (like the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) knoweth the value of it, and will venture through all ſtormes and tempeſts that he may enjoy it. Doſt thou priſe the precepts of Chriſt, the promiſes of Chriſt, the people of Chriſt, the perſon of Chriſt (is that altogether lovely in thine eyes) and the paſſion of Chriſt? Is thy greateſt glory in Chriſts ſhameful Croſs? Doſt thou eſteem it above the higheſt Emperours moſt glorious Crown? One of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Kings, beſtowed as much on a Crucifix, as the revenues of his Crown were worth in a Year. <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
               <p>Doth thy faith purifie thine heart? <hi>Having their hearts purified by faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. The hand of faith which openeth the Door to let Chriſt into the heart, ſweepeth the heart clean. Faith looks to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:172730:162"/>be like Chriſt in glory and faith; labours to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſt in grace. An unbeleiver (like a ſluttiſh Woman) though he keep the room of his life a little clean, which others daily obſerve, yet he cares not how dirtily thoſe rooms of his inward man lye, which are out of their fight; <hi>unbeleiving</hi> and defiled are joyned together, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>Examine thy <hi>love,</hi> The primitive Chriſtians kiſſed each other at the Supper, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oſculum pacis, A kiſs of peace.</hi> They had their feaſts of charity, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 12. <hi>The bread which we eat, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> As the <hi>bread</hi> is made of many grains, and the cup of <hi>wine</hi> of many grapes united; ſo is the body of Chriſt of many members, united under one head. Eating together was ever a ſign of love and friendſhip. <hi>Joſeph</hi> hereby ſhewed his love to his brethren. The Sons of <hi>Brutus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Publico.</note> and the <hi>Vitellii</hi> when they conſpired with <hi>Tarquins</hi> Ambaſſadours, againſt the Conſul, drank the blood of a man together, to confirm their amity.

               <p>Doſt thou love the brethren as brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are related to God, and becauſe they have the Image of God? Or doſt thou love them onely for the natural qualities in them, and their courteſie to thee? this fire I muſt tell thee is Kitchin fire, which muſt be fed with ſuch courſe fuel; the former onely is the fire which is taken from Gods Altar? Doſt thou love Chriſt in a Cottage as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:172730:163"/>well as in a Court? Doſt thou love a poor as well as a rich Chriſtian? Doſt thou love grace in rags, as much as grace in robes? Is it their honour or their holineſs which thou doſt admire?</p>
               <p>As thy duty is to examine thy ſelf concerning thy graces, ſo alſo concerning thy <hi>corruptions.</hi> Before a Sacrament there ſhould be a through ſearch for all thy ſins. The Jews before their paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſearched all over their houſes for <hi>leaven,</hi> nay they ſearched every corner and Mouſe-hole with a wax Candle (as ſome write.) There is a threefold <hi>leaven;</hi> Firſt, a <hi>leaven of Hypocriſie, Beware of the leaven of the</hi> Phariſes, <hi>which is Hypocriſie,</hi> Luk. 12.1. Secondly, a <hi>leaven of Hereſie, a little leaven, leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> Gal. 5.9. Thirdly, a <hi>leaven of Enormity</hi> or <hi>ſcandal, purge out the old leaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. Thy care muſt be to make a diligent enquiry for all this <hi>leaven.</hi> The iniquities of wicked men will find <hi>them out,</hi> but good men will finde out their iniquities. <hi>I know mine iniquites,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 51. When evil humours lie hid in the body, they hinder the ſtrength it might get by food. When ſins lye undiſcovered in the ſoul, they will hinder its digeſting ſpiritual meat and drink.</p>
               <p>At a <hi>Seſſions</hi> there are ſome indictments read, and (it may be) ſome execution done; but at an <hi>Aſſize</hi> there are many Malefactours arraigned, and many executed, the Goal is then cleared of thoſe vermine; A Chriſtian ſhould keep a petty <hi>Seſſions</hi> in his heart every day, do what he can for the conviction and condemnation of his ſins; but
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:172730:163"/>before a Sacrament, he muſt keep an <hi>Aſſize,</hi> there muſt be a general <hi>Goal delivery;</hi> all his ſins muſt be ſought after, indicted and executed; the room of his heart muſt be cleared of thoſe vipers. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly examine thy ſelf of thy ſins ſince the laſt Sacrament; how forgetful thou haſt been of the Oath of the Lord, which thou diſt then enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; be not ſlight or formal in ſearching after thy ſins, like ſome officers, that willingly over-look the Theeves they ſearch for; but be as diligent to find them out, as thou wouldſt be to find out the Murderers of thy father or beſt friend.</p>
               <p>But be ſure thou compare thy heart and life with the Law of God. O how many ſpots will that glaſs diſcover. When the woman hath ſwept her houſe and gathered the duſt up altogether, ſhe thinks there is none left, but when the Sun doth but ſhine in through ſome broken Pane of Glaſs, ſhe ſeeth the whole Houſe ſwarm with innumerable Motes of duſt, floating too and fro in the Air. The light of Gods law will make innumerable ſins viſible to thee, which without it will lie hid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is requiſite as a ſerious examination of thy ſelf, ſo alſo ſincere humiliation for thy ſins. The cleanly Dame is careful always to keep her Peuter and Braſs clean, but againſt a <hi>good time,</hi> ſhe is very curious to have her Veſſels not onely clean but bright, and for this end ſhe will not onely waſh them but take much pains in ſcouring them; Chriſtian, Now is the good time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which thou ſhouldſt ſcour the veſſel of thy heart, that no dirt (if poſſible) may ſtick to it.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:172730:164"/>This true humiliation conſiſteth partly in mourning for ſin, partly in turning from ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In mourning for ſin.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> would not eat their common bread with <hi>unwaſhed hands,</hi> leaſt they ſhould tranſgreſs the traditions of their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Friend, if thou ſhouldſt eat this ſacred bread with an <hi>unwaſhed heart,</hi> thou wilt horribly tranſgreſs the Commandment of thy God. The Jews did eat the Paſſover with <hi>bitter hearbs,</hi> and truely we <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt eat a <hi>broken body</hi> with <hi>broken bones.</hi> The more bitter ſin is to thee before, the more ſweet thy Saviour will be to thee at the Sacrament; <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Mat. 5.3. A wet ſeed time will bring a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiny and plentiful Harveſt. One of the Fathers obſerveth that <hi>David</hi> the greateſt <hi>mourner in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> was the ſweeteſt <hi>ſinger in Iſrael.</hi> Beanes thrive beſt if ſteept in water before they be ſown, and truely ſo will thy ſoul if ſteept in godly ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou goeſt to the Sacrament. <hi>Give ſtrong drink to him that is ready to periſh, and wine to theſe that are of heavy hearts.</hi> Prov. 31.6. When thy heart is heavy under the ſenſe of thine unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thou art ready to periſh under the weight of thy wickedneſs, then Jeſus Chriſt will give thee that wine, that blood which will refreſh and make thine heart glad.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Trees ſhoot higheſt in <hi>Summer,</hi> that ſhoot loweſt into the earth in <hi>Winter;</hi> No Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an uſually riſeth ſo high in conſolation, as he that is caſt down loweſt in Evangelical humiliation. There are two in the New Teſtament famous for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:172730:164"/>their <hi>contrition,</hi> and they are famous for Gods reſpect and <hi>affection</hi> to them. <hi>Mary</hi> was a great <hi>mourner,</hi> We ſeldom have a view of her in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without dew on her face, and tears in her eyes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.27, 28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.25. and 20.11, 15. But ſhe had the ſpecial honour and favour of ſeeing the beſt ſight which ever mortal eyes beheld before all others; even the bleſſed Redeemer in the firſt ſtep of his exaltation. <hi>Now when Jeſus was riſen early the firſt day of the week, he appeared firſt to</hi> Mary Magdalen <hi>out of whom he had caſt ſeven Devils,</hi> Mark 16.9. <hi>Mary</hi> had ſinned greatly, and ſorrowed greatly, and was upon it greatly reſpected by God. <hi>Peter wept bitterly;</hi> A look from love broke his heart in peices; but Chriſt took ſpecial care to bind up this broken heart, to pour Oyl into his wounded conſcience, and therefore when a meſſenger is diſpatched from Heaven to acquaint the World with the joyful news of the Saviours reſurrection, no name is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned in his commiſſion but <hi>Peters.</hi> God gives him an expreſs command, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould remain ignorant of thoſe happy tidings, he ſhould be ſure that <hi>Peter</hi> have notice of it. <hi>Go your way</hi> (ſaith the Angel) <hi>Tell his Diſciples and</hi> Peter, <hi>that he goeth before you into</hi> Galilee, <hi>there ye ſhall ſee him.</hi> When a King hath ſome extra-ordinary good news, and ſendeth a Courtier to acquaint his intimate friends with it, but chargeth him, Tell them all of it, but be ſure ſuch an Earl have notice of it; whoever you forget, remember him; All will conclude this is the <hi>favourite; Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:172730:165"/>thought that becauſe he had forſworn Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt might juſtly forget him; but Chriſt took ſuch care that if but one in the World beſides thoſe two Women at the Sepulchre, had notice of his Reſurrection, penitent <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be the man. O the Rhetorique, the power of an unfeigned tear! Repentance hath more prevalency with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, then all the robes, riches, crowns and Diadems of the greateſt Potentates in the World.</p>
               <p>O Reader, if thou would have heavenly muſick at the feaſt, mind this holy mourning; when <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren were ſenſible of their ſin in ſelling him, then and not till then he made them a feaſt. Jeſus Chriſt made the beſt wine that ever was, of water. The Bee (<hi>Naturaliſts</hi> tell us) gather the beſt hony of the bittereſt hearb; God hath ſolid joy for the broken bones, the contrite ſpirit; caſt up the accounts betwixt God and thy ſoul, ſee how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art indebted to his Majeſty, <hi>Abhor thy ſelf,</hi> with <hi>Job, Bemoan thy ſelf,</hi> with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and judge thy ſelf (as <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyneth his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in relation to this ordinance) as ever thou wouldſt have God at the Sacrament to ſeal thee a general acquittance.</p>
               <p>Sacrament-days are ſealing days; God doth then ſeal his love and ſtamp his Image more fairly on the ſoul; now if thy heart be melted into godly ſorrow, and made thereby like ſoft wax, thou wilt be fit for this ſeal and ſtamp. The Hart in graſing kills and eates a Serpent whith ſo inflames her, that ſhe can have no reſt till ſhe drink of the water brooks. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will make thee feel the ſcorching nature
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:172730:165"/>of that Serpent, <hi>ſin,</hi> and thereby long for and reliſh the water of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be a <hi>turning from ſin.</hi> Thou canſt never communicate <hi>with true comfort,</hi> if thou doſt not communicate with a <hi>clear conſcience.</hi>

As thy duty is to waſh thy ſoul in godly ſorrow, ſo alſo to put off thy ſinful affections, before thou entreſt into Gods houſe to partake of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. If God takes it ill when men take his <hi>Name</hi> into their mouthes, <hi>who hate to be reformed,</hi> how ill will he take it, if ſuch take the <hi>body and blood</hi> of his Son into their mouthes! Chriſts body was not to ſee corruption, neither will it mingle with corruption. He lay in a new womb, in a new tomb, and he will lye in a new heart. When ſin is caſt out, then Jeſus Chriſt will enter into thy ſoul. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> But mark how they muſt prepare themſelves, who would approach the Lord, <hi>Cleanſe your hearts ye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and purifie your hands ye double minded.</hi> Ja. 4.8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Jews before the Paſſover cleanſed all their Veſſels, which they feared might have Leaven ſticking to them, burnt all the Leaven they could find, and curſed all in their houſes whether found or not found; as their Antiquaries informe us. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when thou goeſt to the Supper, it concerneth thee to cleanſe thy ſoul of the leaven of ſin; by an high indignation at it, and hearty reſolution againſt it. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump; for Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:172730:166"/>for us. Therefore let us keep the feaſt not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. Reader, It would be a trampling under foot the blood of Chriſt, and counting it as an unholy thing, if thou ſhouldſt go to the Table of the Lord with love to any luſt; For the Lords ſake, and for thy ſouls ſake, take heed of padling in the blood of Chriſt as if it were Kennel water. Alaſs, thou doſt little leſs if thou partakeſt of the Sacrament without anger and indignation againſt every ſin. True repentance implyeth an <hi>averſion</hi> from ſin. <hi>If they ſhall humble themſelves, and turn from their evil ways,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.14. The burnt Child will dread the fire. The man that hath ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſurety-ſhip, will by no means be perſwaded to come again into bonds; Urge him to it never ſo much, he will tell you he hath paid dear for it, and therefore you muſt excuſe him; he is reſolved, nay hath vowed againſt it, and though he be never ſo much intreated, is ſtill inexorable. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who hath truely repented, is ſo ſenſible of the weight of ſin and wrath of God, that he is reſolved never more to meddle with thoſe burning coals; Alas they are too heavy for him: <hi>David</hi> that had repented of his ſin, would not drink of that water which had but been the occaſion of hazarding mens lives, though before he could drink the blood of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Penitent <hi>Peter</hi> though before he was ſo full of ſelf confidence, that he preferred himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other Apoſtles; <hi>Though all deny thee, yet will not I;</hi> yet afterwards, though occaſion were
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:172730:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>offered him of commending himſelf, forbears it; <hi>Peter, loveſt thou me more then theſe? Lord thou knoweſt I love thee.</hi> He ſaith, not <hi>more then theſe.</hi> O Reader, It was <hi>Eſaus</hi> expreſſion, <hi>The days of mourning for my father are coming, and then I will ſlay my brother</hi> Jacob; ſo ſay thou, <hi>The days of mourning for the death of my dear Saviour, and everlaſting father are come, and now I will ſlay my moſt beloved luſts; now will I be revenged of them for their endeavour to rob me of my ſpiritual birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to wrong me of my eternal bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This repentance exerciſed before the Sacrament, would prepare thy ſtomach for the Feaſt, it would cleanſe it, and cauſe it to ſavour the dainties there; It would make the hungry, <hi>and hunger is the beſt ſauce. Artaxerxes</hi> flying for his life, fed on barly bread, and a few dryed figs, and ſaid, <hi>It was the beſt meal that ever he made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When thou haſt thus prepared thy ſtomach for this heavenly Banquet, take heed of relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy pains, and preparation, either for a right performance of the duty, or for thine acceptance in the Ordinance. Many a poor creature I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded goeth with much humiliation for ſin, and cometh away without any conſolation, becauſe they made a Saviour of their ſorrow. Praiſe thy Phyſition, if he have made the ſenſible of thy ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but do not provoke him by making thy pain to be the plaiſter for thy cure. Alas, thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration it ſelf needeth much pardon; if God ſhould deal ſtrictly with thee, thy prayers would be found dung, thy ſighs unſavory breath, thy very
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:172730:167"/>tears puddle water. Reflect on them thy ſelf, and compare them with the Law of God, and thou wilt find cauſe to pray over thy prayers, to weep over thy tears, to be aſhamed of thy ſhame, and to abhor thy ſelf for thy ſelf abhorrency.</p>
               <p>Do not think with thy ſelf, I have examined my heart faithfully, and find that I do not come ſhort of the grace of God; I have acknowledged mine iniquities, and been ſorrowful for my ſins, and therefore I cannot miſcarry at this Sacrament. Such a <hi>truſting</hi> of thy ſelf, would be a tempting of thy Saviour, and would certainly hinder the ſucceſs of the Sacrament: It would be to thee, as the cutting off <hi>Sampſons</hi> locks was to him:
<note place="margin">Judg 16.20.</note> 
                  <hi>He thought to have gone forth as at other times, and ſhake himſelf: And he wiſt not that the Lord was departed from him.</hi> Thou mayeſt think after ſuch ſelf-confidence, to go to the Lords Supper as at other times; but alas, what wilt thou do? for the Lord will depart from thee; and then what ſport will Satan and ſin, thoſe uncircumciſed ones make with thee?</p>
               <p>Reader, let me perſwade thee when thou haſt been diligent in the trial of thy ſpiritual eſtate, and haſt with many tears bewailed the pollution of thy nature, and tranſgreſſions of thy life, to caſt thy ſelf wholly upon Jeſus Chriſt for aſſiſtance in the duty. As Jehoſaphat when he had 50000. men ready Armed for the battel, cryed out, <hi>O Lord our God, we have no might againſt this great company,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.6</note> neither know we what to do, but our eyes are unto thee.</hi> So after thou haſt made the greateſt preparation poſſible, as beleiving the weight
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:172730:167"/>and worth of the ſupper, the purity and Majeſty of the Maſter of the Feaſt, do thou look up to Chriſt and ſay, <hi>Lord, I have no ability, no might for this great ſupper, for a right performance of this great ordinance, neither know I what to do but my eys are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> When <hi>Aſa</hi> had an Army of two hundredand fourſcore thouſand men of valour to fight with the <hi>Ethiophians,</hi> he prayeth and truſteth to God, as if he had not one man. <hi>Lord, it is nothing for thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power. Help us O Lord God, for we reſt on thee,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 8, 1.</note> and in thy name we go againſt this great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> So do thou ſay, <hi>Lord, I have no power for this holy Supper; help me O Lord my God, for I reſt on thee, and in thy name I go to this great and weighty Ordinance.</hi> Truely couldſt thou after all the proviſion thou haſt made, diſclaim it wholly in regard of dependance, and caſt thy ſelf on Chriſt for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I durſt be the Prophet to foretel a good day. The gaudy flower which ſtandeth upon its own ſtalk, doth quickly wither, when the plain Ivy that depends upon the houſe and leans on it, is freſh and green all the year; He that truſteth to his own legs in this duty, is as ſure to fall as if he were down already; the weak child walketh ſafeſt that all the way holdeth by, and hangeth upon its parent.</p>
               <p>If thou wert now going to receive, be adviſed to write after <hi>Davids</hi> Copy. He looked up to God, both for aſſiſtance and acceptance; <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord, I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, yea of thine onely,</hi> Pſa. 71.16. Let
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:172730:168"/>thy practice be ſutable to his, when thou goeſt out of thy houſe; And let thy prayer be the ſame with the Spouſes when thou art entring into Gods houſe; O then look up to heaven and cry mightily, <hi>Awake thou Northwind, and come O South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out.

               <p>I Come to the ſecond particular about the Lords Supper,
<note place="margin">Secondly,</note> and that is thy <hi>behaviour at the Table,</hi> or in the time of receiving. In reference to which I would adviſe thee, 1. To mind the ſutable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are to be conſidered at it. 2. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſpecial graces which are to be exerciſed in it. There are three principal <hi>ſubjects of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> when thou approacheſt the Table, in order to the three graces which muſt then be acted. The Subjects of meditation are <hi>Chriſts paſſion,</hi> his <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and thy own <hi>corruptions.</hi> The three graces are <hi>Faith, Love, and godly ſorrow.</hi> Chriſts death is ſure footing for Faith. <hi>Paul</hi> never deſired better, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. it is not onely an <hi>elect and precious, but a tried ſtone and a ſure foundation on which whoſoever beleiveth ſhall never be confounded.</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Faith picks excellent food from this heavenly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs. The <hi>love of Chriſt diſplayed</hi> in his death,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:172730:168"/>cauſeth and calleth forth the <hi>love of a Chriſtian.</hi> Faith bringeth the ſoul (that is like a dead coal) near to the live coals of Gods burning love, in giving his onely Son, and Chriſts burning love in giving himſelf, and by theſe it is turned into fire, all in a <hi>flame of love;</hi> as the Eccho anſwereth the voice, it returneth the love it receiveth. Our own ſins meditated on, ſtit up the third grace, which is <hi>godly ſorrow.</hi> Though indeed this liquor will run from any of the three Veſſels, if they be but peirced. When Chriſt hung upon the Croſs under the weight of Gods wrath, <hi>water</hi> came out of his ſides as well as <hi>blood.</hi> Who can think of his ſufferings without ſorrow? and of his blood without tears? His love in its heat, may well thaw the moſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſpirit; but ſin the cauſe of his ſufferings will like a knife cut and prick to the heart indeed; but</p>
               <p>Firſt, I begin with the <hi>ſubjects of meditation,</hi> and among them in the firſt place with the <hi>paſſion</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Meditate now on the <hi>ſuffering of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi> the wound of Chriſt out of which came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious balſom to heal all thy ſinful ſores, ought never to be forgotten; but the remembrance of them is never ſo ſeaſonable as at a Sacrament. One end of the inſtitution of this Ordinance, was the commemoration of Chriſts death; <hi>As oft as ye eat this brrad, and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27. The Sacrament is a lively crucifix, wherein Jeſus Chriſt is evidently ſet forth, crucified before thine
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:172730:169"/>eyes. When thou ſeeſt the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi> and ſet apart, conſider how God the Father did from eternity <hi>ſet a part his onely Son</hi> for his bloody paſſion, and thy bleſſed redemption. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider he was a Lamb ſlain before the foundation of the World. When thou ſeeſt the bread and wine upon the Table, conſider that as the Corn was ground in the Mill, to make that bread, and the grapes ſquezed to make that wine, ſo thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was beaten in the Mill, and Wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath, before he could be <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and <hi>drink indeed,</hi> to nouriſh thee unto life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When thou ſeeſt the bread broken in peices, think how the body of Chriſt was broken for thine iniquities. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him</hi> (as Spice is beaten ſmall in a mortar with a Peſſel, ſo the word ſignifieth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10.) Well might he cry out, <hi>I am feeble and ſore broken, I have roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of my heart,</hi> Pſa. 38.8. When thou ſeeſt the Wine poured out, meditate on his precious blood, <hi>which was ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> O conſider his wounds and his words, <hi>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are ont of joynt, my heart is like Wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels,</hi> Pſa: 22.14. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the doleful tragedy which he acted from firſt to laſt; Meditate on his <hi>incarnation.</hi> For the <hi>Son of God</hi> to become the <hi>Son of man;</hi> for him that lived from all eternity to be born in time; for him that thundereth in the clouds, to cry in the Cradle; for him that created all things, to become a creature, is a greater ſuffering, then if all the men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:172730:169"/>in this and the other World were crowded into an atome, or turned into nothing. This was the firſt and greateſt ſtep of his humiliation. Conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of his birth; he was born, not of ſome great Princes, but of mean and indigent Parents; not in a Royal Palace, but in a place where Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Beaſts are entertained, a <hi>Stable;</hi> he was no ſooner born, but ſought after to be butchered. He fled for his life in his very ſwadling clouts, and was an early <hi>Martyr</hi> indeed. When he grew up, though he was of ability to have ſway'd the Scepter of all the Empires in the World, to have inſtructed the greateſt Potentates and Counſellours in the myſteries of wiſdom and knowledge; though to him <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> yea and Angels themſelves were fools; yet he lived privately with his ſuppoſed Father many years, and ſuffered his deity to be hid as light in a Dark Lanthorn neer thirty years, ſave that once it darted a little out, when at twelve years of age he diſputed, which confuted the great Rabbies of the Jews, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.46.</p>
               <p>When he entred upon his publique Miniſtry, he is no ſooner aſcended the Stage, but all the Divels in Hell appear againſt him, and he is forced to fight hand to hand with them for forty days together, and when they left him, they did not take their leave, <hi>but departed onely for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luk. 4.13. His whole life was a living death. How poor was he, when he was fain to work a miracle to pay his Tax! <hi>The Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the Air had Neſts, but the Son of man had not where to lay his head,</hi> though he were <hi>heir of all things,</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:172730:170"/>Mat. 8.20. What did he ſuffer in his name, when the worſt words in the mouths of the Jews were thought not bad enough for him? He is called the <hi>Carpenters Son, a Glutton, a Drunkard, a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a friend of Publicans and ſinners, a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, a Devil, nay the Prince of Devils.</hi> What hunger, and thirſt, and wearineſs did he undergo? He that feeds others with his own fleſh, had many an hungry belly. He that gave others that water of which whoſoever drinketh ſhall thirſt no more, had his own veins ſucking and paining him for thirſt. He that is himſelf the onely Ark for the weary Dove to flie too for reſt, did himſelf take many a weariſom ſtep, and travail many a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome journey. Well might the Prophet call him, <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with greifs,</hi> though he had ſuffered no more then what is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy written, but all this was but the <hi>beginning of his ſorrows.</hi> The dregs of the cup were at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Doubtleſs many an aking heart had he (as a Woman with Child) beforehand when he thought of the bitter pangs, ſharp throws, and hard labour, which he was to ſuffer at the cloſe of his life. O Friend, <hi>Remember this Son of</hi> David <hi>and all his troubles;</hi> but to come to his end which is ſpecially repreſented in this Ordinance; I will take him in the <hi>Garden,</hi> where he felt more then I can write or think. Conſider his body there, it was all over in a <hi>goar blood;</hi> Ah what ſuffered he when he did ſweat <hi>clods of blood.</hi> To ſweat <hi>blood</hi> is againſt nature, much more in a <hi>cold ſeaſon,</hi> moſt of all when he was full of fear and terrour, then the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:172730:170"/>blood retreats to the heart to guard it, and to be guarded by it.</p>
               <p>But behold, Reader, thy Saviour for thy ſake, and under the weight of thy ſins, did ſweat <hi>blood</hi> in a <hi>cold night,</hi> when he was <hi>exceedingly afraid:</hi> Ah, who would not love ſuch a Saviour; and who would not loath ſin! But the ſufferings of his <hi>body</hi> were nothing, to the ſufferings of his <hi>ſoul;</hi> theſe were the <hi>ſoul</hi> of his ſufferings. Obſerve his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful: My ſoul is ſorrowful unto death. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto death;</hi> not onely <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively,</hi> ſeventeen or eighteen hours, till death ended his life; but chiefly <hi>Intenſively,</hi> ſuch ſorrow as the pangs of death bring, ſurely far greater. Again, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me:</hi> Wiſe and valiant men do not complain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Ah, how bitter was that cup which Valour and Reſolution it ſelf ſeemed unwilling to drink! The two moſt tormenting paſſions which are, <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> did now ſeize upon him in the higheſt degree: <hi>He began to be ſorrowful, and very heavy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. <hi>He began to be ſore amazed, and very heavy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mark, Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>Reader, follow him farther; One <hi>Diſciple</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him at the price of a <hi>Slave;</hi> another Diſciple <hi>forſweareth</hi> him; all of them for ſake him, and fly; the greedy <hi>Wolves</hi> lay hold on this innocent <hi>Lamb;</hi> the bloody Jews apprehend him, binde his hands like a Thief, and hale him away to the High-Prieſt; then they hire perſons to belye Truth it ſelf: But when their teſtimony was inſufficient, upon his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:172730:171"/>own moſt holy confeſſion, a ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is paſt upon him. Conſider now how the ſervants ſmite his bleſſed cheeks with their fiſts, and ſpit on that beautiful face with their mouths, <hi>which Angels counted their honor to behold;</hi> the Maſters flout him with their ſcornful carriage, and mock him with their petulant language: He muſt be the <hi>ſink</hi> into which they fling all their <hi>ſilth.</hi> Afterwards they carry him to <hi>Pilate;</hi> he ſendeth him to <hi>Herod; Herod</hi> with ſome ſcorns and ſcoffs ſendeth him back: Thus is he, like a foot-bal, ſpurned up and down between thoſe inhumane wretches: <hi>Pilate</hi> tears his fleſh with <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>wails,</hi> and preſenteth him to the people with a <hi>crown of Thorns</hi> on his head, to move pity; the people thirſting after his blood, can by no words be perſwaded, by no means be prevailed with, to let this innocent Dove eſcape. Though he be put in competition with a Murtherer, yet the Murtherer is preferred before him; and as the worſt of the two, he is at laſt condemned as a ſeditious perſon, and a Traytor againſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> Crown and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be crucified without the gate, leſt the City ſhould be polluted with his blood. Now, Reader, come along like the beloved Diſciple, and behold thy Saviour bearing his own Croſs, and going to the place of execution, to dye the death of a Slave; for no Freeman was ever crucified; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Julian</hi> in deriſion called him, <hi>The ſtaked God.</hi> He is no ſooner come to the diſmal place of dead mens skulls, but they tear off his cloathes (and ſome think skin and all) glued to his back with
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:172730:171"/>their bloody ſcourgings. Now they ſtretch his body, as cloth with tenters, and rack it ſo that his bones ſtart out of his skin: (<hi>I may tell all my bones,</hi> Pſal. 22.17.) in nailing his two hands to the two horns, and his feet (thoſe parts ſo full of nerves and ſinews, and ſo the moſt ſenſible of any parts of the body) to the ſtump of the Croſs: <hi>(They digged my hands and my feet:)</hi> and hang him up between two Thieves, as the moſt notorious Malefactor of the three: <hi>He was numbred among the Trangreſſors.</hi> His bloody, watching, faſting, ſcorched, wracked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is oppreſſed with exquiſite pain, and his anguiſh ſo vehement, that he cryeth out, <hi>I thirſt;</hi> to quench which, they give him vinegar and gall, and ſpice it with a ſcoff to make it relliſh the better; <hi>Let us ſee whether Elias will come and ſave him.</hi> But Oh! who can imagine what he ſuffered in his ſoul, when he hung under the weight of mens revenge, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils rage, the Laws curſe, and the Lords wrath! Men revile him, wagging their heads, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, and buildeſt it in three days, ſave they ſelf: He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave: To him that was afflicted, pity ſhould have been ſhewn; but they added affliction to the afflicted, and forſook the fear of the Almighty.</hi> All the Devils in Hell were now putting forth their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power and policy <hi>(for this was their hour, and the power of darkneſs)</hi> to encreaſe his ſufferings, that if poſſible, they might provoke him to ſin, thereby to have ſeparated his Humane nature from his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that it might have periſhed eternally, and all mankinde with it; but the ſting of his death is yet
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:172730:172"/>behind. The head of that arrow which pierced his heart indeed, was the frown of his Father: That his <hi>Kinſmen,</hi> the Jews, whom he came to ſanctifie and redeem; (for he was <hi>the glory of his people Iſrael</hi>) ſhould deliver him up to be crucified, was not a ſmall aggravation of his miſery: That his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that had been eye-witneſſes of his miracles, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of his Oracles (to whom he had ſpoken ſo pathetically, <hi>Will ye alſo forſake me?</hi> and who had told him ſo reſolutely, <hi>We will go with thee into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to death,</hi> Luke 22.33. Mat. 26.35.) ſhould now in his greateſt extremity turn their backs upon him, added ſome more gall to his bitter cap: That his <hi>Mother</hi> ſhould ſtand by the Croſs <hi>weeping,</hi> and have her ſoul pierced through with the ſword of his ſufferings, was far from being an allay to his ſorrows; but that his <hi>Father,</hi> of whom he had often boaſted, <hi>It is my Father that honoreth me, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth me, I and my Father are one,</hi> ſhould now in his low eſtate, in his day of adverſity, in his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hour, not onely not help him, and leave him alone, as an harmleſs Dove, amongſt ſo many rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Vultures, to conteſt with all the fury of Earth and Hell; but alſo pour out the Vials of his own Wrath upon him, and (though the Union was not diſſolved, yet) ſuffer the beams, the influences to be reſtrained, that he might fully bear the curſe of the Law, and feel the weight of ſin; this was the <hi>hotteſt fire</hi> in which the Paſchal Lamb was roaſted; this cauſed that Heart-breaking, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting, Heaven-piercing expreſſion, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> O how! how juſtly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:172730:172"/>might he have cryed out with <hi>Joh. Have pity upon me my friend, have pity upon me, for the hand</hi> (not onely of my Enemies and my friends, of multitudes of men, and of Legions of Divels, but the hand) <hi>of God hath touched me.</hi> How truely might the Husband have taken up his Spouſes lamentation. <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? Behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> Ah who can write or read ſuch a tragedy with dry eyes.</p>
               <p>Friend, when thou art at the Sacrament, think of theſe ſufferings, and beleive it, they will make work among thy ſins. When thou takeſt the <hi>cup of wine,</hi> do not forget the <hi>cup of Worm-wood,</hi> which thy Saviour drunk for thy ſake; <hi>he drank of the Brook in the way,</hi> he drank the cup of his Fathers wrath infinitely imbittered with the curſe of the law, that thou mighteſt drink <hi>the cup of bleſſing.</hi> At the Table obey his own command, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Meditate on the <hi>affection of Chriſt. We will remember thy love more then wine,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, when thou ſeeſt the wine; think of that love which is better then wine. Belevie it, if ever there were a <hi>love-feaſt,</hi> this is it. Men teſtifie their love in beſtowing food on their hungry friends, but ah what love was that which gave his bleſſed body and precious blood to feed his ſtarving enemies. He that conſidereth what Chriſt ſuffered, and for whom, may well think he was little elſe, but a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:172730:173"/>
                  <hi>lump of love;</hi> His compaſſion is infinitely viſible in his paſſion. What love was that which moved him to lay down his life for thee! Friend, if ever thou hadſt hard thoughs of Chriſt, take a view of him in the former ſubject of meditation, and conſider whether his heart be not ſet upon ſinners, when he ſhed his heart blood for their ſouls. The redneſs of the fire diſcovers its heat. O how did the redneſs of this <hi>Roſe of Sharon,</hi> the blood which iſſued from his head, and back, and hands, and feet, and heart, and whole body, ſpeak his burning, his fiery love! Well might the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> joyn and pair thoſe Turtle-Doves; <hi>Who hath loved us and waſhed us in his blood,</hi> Rev. 1.5. In every drop of his blood there is an <hi>Ocean</hi> of love. Well might the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oduce this as an undeniable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the truth of his love, <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. His bleeding paſſion was ſuch a full demonſtration of his deareſt affection, as the whole World never ſaw the like before, nor ever ſhall again. In it his love was diſſected and ript up; you may tell all its bones. <hi>Judas</hi> gave him to the Jews, out of love to money; The Jews gave him to <hi>Pilate</hi> to becondemned, out of love to envy; <hi>Pilate</hi> gives him to the Souldiers to be Crucified, out of love to ſelf intereſt; but Chriſt gave himſelf out of pure love to ſave ſouls. The great and glorious God doth things that are ſingularly <hi>eminent</hi> for the manifeſtation of his <hi>attributes.</hi> When he would evidence his <hi>power,</hi> he produceth with a word the whole creation out of the barren Womb of nothing; He did
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:172730:173"/>but will it, and the whole world preſently ſtarted into a being. By this he often proves his deity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.11. As ſhadows repreſent the figure of thoſe bodies from whence they are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo do the creatures manifeſt the power of their Maker.</p>
               <p>When he would manifeſt his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he layeth the dark vault of Hell, and layeth in, and ſtoreth it with fire, and brimſtone, and chains, and blackneſs of darkneſs, and gnawing wormes, and pure wrath, and Devils, and all the inſtruments of eternal death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. When he would make known his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> he findeth out a fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and thereby reconcileth thoſe attributes which before were at ods, his <hi>juſtice</hi> and his <hi>mercy.</hi> When man was fallen, <hi>juſtice</hi> pleaded for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved damnation, according to the threatnings of the law; <hi>mercy</hi> pleadeth for his gracious ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he being deluded by the Devil. Now it would have non-pluſt the heads of all the men and Angels in the World, had they been united in a conſultation, to have found out a way to ſatisfie both the demands of juſtice, and the intreaties of mercy; but God did it; he cauſeth <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> to meet together, <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to kiſs each other; therefore the Mediatour is called <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14 and the finding out this way is called <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> or the <hi>embroydered Wiſdom of God,</hi> Eph. 3.10. Its an alluſion to a curious peice of Needle-work, wherein there are various expreſſions of Art. So in this way of mans recovery, there are various
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:172730:174"/>and curious expreſſions of divine wiſdom. But when God would proclaim his <hi>love,</hi> that attribute which like Oyl ſwimmeth at the top of them all, which is moſt in favour, which he delighteth ſo exceedingly in, what will he do? Why, he layeth down his life, <hi>greater love then this hath no man, then that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Joh. 15.13. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhewed his love to <hi>Rachel</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the heat of the day, and the cold of the night for her. But Jeſus ſhewed his love to his beautiful Spouſe, by undergoing the curſed, painful, and ſhameful death of the Croſs for her. O what love was that? It is ſtoried of the <hi>Pelican,</hi> that when her young ones are ſtung with ſome poiſonous Serpent, ſhe beats her breaſt with her beak, till the warm blood guſheth out, which they ſuck and recover. We were all ſtung mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally by the Old Serpent the Devil, but behold the love of this heavenly <hi>Pelican,</hi> he lets out his heart blood to recover us. In his birth and life he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his love, the midſt of that Chariot in which he drew his Spouſe before, <hi>was paved with love;</hi> but his death wrot his love in the greateſt Print, in the largeſt Character, though all in red letters, for his whole body was the book, his precious blood was the ink, the nails were the pens, the contents of it from the beginning to the end are <hi>Love, Love.</hi> There is nothing elſe to be read, but <hi>Love, Love in this was manifeſt the Love of God</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9.) His love before was glorious, yet hid as the Sun under a cloud, but at his death it did ſhine forth in its Meridian Splendor, in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:172730:174"/>its noon-day brightneſs, with ſuch hot beams and refreſhing rays, that every one muſt needs take notice of it. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> that if the Lamp of <hi>Love</hi> were quite extinct, it might be lighted again at his brain: How true is this of Chriſt? If Love were quite loſt amongſt all the Creatures, all might be found in Jeſus Chriſt: His name is <hi>love,</hi> his nature is <hi>love,</hi> all his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were <hi>love,</hi> all his actions were <hi>love,</hi> he brought <hi>love,</hi> he bought <hi>love,</hi> he preached <hi>love,</hi> his lips dropt <hi>love;</hi> he practiſed <hi>love,</hi> he lived in <hi>love,</hi> he was ſick of <hi>love,</hi> nay he dyed for <hi>love;</hi> 'twas <hi>love</hi> that took upon him our natures, 'twas <hi>love</hi> that walked in our fleſh, 'twas <hi>love</hi> that went up and down doing good, 'twas <hi>love</hi> that took our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that gave ſight to the blinde, ſpeech to the dumb, ears to the deaf, life to the dead; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that was hungry, and thirſty, and weary; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that was in a bloody agony; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that was ſorrowful unto his own death, and my life; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that was betrayed, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, derided, ſcourged, condemned, and crucified; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that had his head pierced with thorns, his back with cords, his hands and feet with nails, and his ſide with a ſpear; 'twas <hi>love</hi> that cryed out, <hi>Weep not for me, weep for your ſelves: Father, forgive them, they know not what they do: Love</hi> left a glorious Crown, and <hi>love</hi> climbed a ſhameful Croſs: O deareſt Saviour, whither did thy <hi>love</hi> carry thee!</p>
               <p>Reader, I could loſe my ſelf in this pleaſant Maze of Chriſts <hi>love:</hi> Methinks thy heart ſhould
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:172730:175"/>be raviſhed with the ſenſe of this <hi>love.</hi> The truth is, it is a bottomleſs love, none can ſound it; the Apoſtle might well call it, <hi>A known unknown love,</hi> Epheſ. 3.19. It is well thou canſt finde it, but I am ſure thou canſt not fadom it. One Diſciple may ſhew his love to another, by giving a cup of cold water; but the Maſter ſhewed his love to his Diſciples, by broaching his heart to give them a cup of warm blood. The Sacraments, as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerveth, did flow out of the ſides of Chriſt: When the Souldier pierced his ſide, there came out <hi>Water</hi> (for <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) and <hi>Blood</hi> for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Reader, when thou beholdeſt the broken bread, and remembreſt the bruiſed body of Chriſt, do not forget his <hi>love,</hi> which is the beſt ſauce to thy meat. I muſt tell thee, though there be never ſo many diſhes at the Table, this <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>Banquet.</hi> Conſider his willingneſs to be wounded for thee, becauſe his heart was ſo deeply wounded with <hi>love</hi> to thee. Thou haſt heard of ſuch indignities and injuries offered to him, as the Sun himſelf was aſhamed to behold, and hid himſelf from them; yet Chriſt was ready for them, and willing to them: The Lamb of God did not ſtruggle, when he was led to the ſlaughter, but did bear his own Croſs: He was his own <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as well as his own <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Altar.</hi> His death was <hi>violent,</hi> in regard of others; but <hi>voluntary,</hi> in regard of himſelf: He cryed to his Father, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.4. When his ſinleſs nature had a reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt it (though when he was in a bloody
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:172730:175"/>ſweat) he ſoon corrects it with, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> He went to the place which <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> knew, <hi>John</hi> 18.2. He ſtruck them (that came to apprehend him) down, to ſhew that he could, if he had pleaſed, have ſtruck them dead. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they ſhall want proof for his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will confeſs himſelf guilty of the charge: He might (if he had liſted) have commiſſionated twelve Legions of Angels for his Life-guard, but he forbore it: <hi>He laid down his life, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He gave up the Ghoſt: He had a Baptiſm to be baptized with, and he longed to have it accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But Friend, what thinkeſt thou was the lump of ſugar which did ſo ſweeten this cup (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all its bitter ingredients) to make it go down ſo glib and pleaſant? truly nothing but <hi>love.</hi> Love to <hi>Dinah</hi> made <hi>Sechem</hi> willing to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; love to Chriſtians, made Chriſt willing to bleed, and be buffeted, and crucified. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can toil and moil all day with her childe, and count it a pleaſure (when another had rather go to plough all day;) but what's the reaſon? nothing but her love. Jeſus Chriſt delighted in the work of mans Redemption; <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God,</hi> which would have broke the backs of the very Angels; and why? becauſe of his love.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved, the <hi>myrrhe</hi> which is let out by the inciſion of the tree, is precious; but that which floweth of its own accord, is moſt choice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Chriſts veins were indeed opened by others inciſion, when <hi>Pilat</hi> ſcourged his back, and the nails his hands and feet; but one drop of this blood
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:172730:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>is more worth then millions of World; for even at theſe times he bled voluntarily, as well as in the Garden, when the myrrhe of his blood dropt of its own accord: O, of vvhat infinite value is his blood! O, hovv much did he love his, vvhen the very oyl vvhich conſecrated him to thoſe unknovvn ſorrovvs, vvas the oyl of gladneſs to him! Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this love more then vvine:</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Meditate on <hi>thy corruptions:</hi> As his love vvas the invvard moving cauſe; ſo thy ſins vvere the outvvard procuring cauſe of his ſufferings: <hi>He was wounded for thy tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for thine iniquities, the chaſtiſement of thy peace was upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. When thou art at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vvhich fitly repreſenteth <hi>Chriſts ſufferings,</hi> conſider vvith <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> What vvas that vvhich brought the bleſſed Saviour into ſuch a bleeding condition! It vvas my ſin, I vvas the <hi>Judas</hi> vvhich betrayed him, the <hi>Jew</hi> vvhich apprehended him, the <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned him, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> vvhich crucified him: My <hi>ſins</hi> vvere the <hi>thorns</hi> vvhich pierced his <hi>head,</hi> the <hi>nails</hi> vvhich pierced his <hi>hands,</hi> and the <hi>ſpear</hi> vvhich pierced his <hi>heart:</hi> 'Tvvas! that put to death the Lord of life: He dyed for my ſins; <hi>He was made ſin for me, who knew no ſin;</hi> his blood, is my balm; his <hi>Golgatha,</hi> is my <hi>Gilead.</hi> O vvhat a ſubject is here for meditation! <hi>He ſuffered in my ſtead, he bore my ſins in his body on the tree, he took that loathſome purging phyſick for the diſeaſes of my ſoul: When he was in the Garden in his bloody agony, groveling on the ground, there was no</hi> Judas, <hi>no</hi> Pilate, <hi>no Jew, no Gentile there,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:172730:176"/>to cauſe that unnatural ſweat, or to make his ſoul ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful unto death, but my pride, my unbeleif, my hypocriſie, my atheiſm, my blaſphemy, my unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, my carnal-mindedneſs, they were there and cauſed his inward bleeding ſorrows, and outward bloody ſufferings, (Ah what an heavy weight was my ſin to cauſe ſuch a bloody ſweat in a froſty night!) My diſſimulation was the trayterous kiſs; My ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thorny crown. My drinking iniquities like water made him drink Gall and Vineger; My want of tears cauſed him to bleed; My forſaking my Maker, made him to be forſaken of his Father. Becauſe the members of my body were inſtruments of iniquity, therefore the members of his body were objects of ſuch cruelty; becauſe my ſoul was ſo unholy, therefore his ſoul was ſo exceeding heavy. O my ſoul what haſt thou done!</hi>

               <p>We do not ſay the Executioner kils a man for theft or murder; but his theft or murder, they hang him; ſo in this caſe, it was not ſo much the Jews, or Souldiers (for they were the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) that put Chriſt to death, as our thefts and murders, and breaches of Gods Law, which were imputed and laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtory of a King of <hi>France</hi> named <hi>ladoveyus,</hi> that when he was converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, one day hearing <hi>Remigius</hi> the Biſhop read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of our Saviours paſſion, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell into this paſſionate expreſſion, <hi>O that I had been but there with my French-men, I would have cut all their throats;</hi> little conſidering that his and others iniquities were Chriſts greateſt and moſt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:172730:177"/>cruel enemies. Reader when thou art at the Table, think of thoſe ſins which cauſed ſuch ſufferings. Conſider the deepneſs of that ſtain, which the blood onely of God could waſh out. Ah what a ſickneſs is ſin, when nothing leſs then the blood of the Son of God can heal it!</p>
               <p>Secondly, as at the Table ſome Subjects muſt be conſidered, ſo ſome <hi>graces muſt be exerciſed;</hi> A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſpecial ſeaſon, a ſpring time for thoſe trees of Gods own planting, to bud, bloſſom, and put forth their fruit.

               <p>Firſt, Act <hi>faith; Dormit fides &amp; dormit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin; If faith ſleepeth, Chriſt ſleepeth.</hi> Call forth firſt that Commander in chief, and then the private Souldiers, the other graces will all follow. <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be the eye whereby thou ſeeſt Chriſt, <hi>Zach</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have peirced, and mourn; Faith</hi> is the mouth by
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:172730:177"/>which thou feedeſt on Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Faith</hi> is the feet by which thou goeſt to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>Faith</hi> may ſay to thee as Chriſt did, <hi>Without me thou canſt do nothing;</hi> without me thou canſt do nothing for thy own welfare, nothing for Gods honour at this ordinance; It is ſaid of the <hi>Indian Gymnoſophiſts</hi> that they will lye all day upon their backs gazing on the beauty of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sun. Friend, at this Ordinance if at any time of thy life, view the beauty of this true Sun. As <hi>Pilate</hi> when he had ſcourged him in ſuch a bloody, barbarous manner, brings him forth to the Jews, with, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> So when thou conſidereſt the bread and wine, <hi>Behold the man; Behold the broken bruiſed Saviour.</hi> A man without faith, like the unbeleiving lord, ſeeth the plenty, but doth not eat of it.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold act of Faith to be put forth at a Sacrament. Firſt, Faith muſt look out for Chriſt. Secondly, Faith muſt look up to Chriſt for grace. Thirdly, Faith muſt take Chriſt down or receive him and grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith muſt look out for Chriſt:</hi> Conſider that Jeſus Chriſt is the very ſoul of the Sacrament; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him it is but the carcaſs of an Ordinance. <hi>Chriſt and the Scripture bring comfort; Chriſt and prayer cauſe ſpiritual profit; Accedat Chriſtus ad elementum, &amp; fiet Sacramentum. Chriſt and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make a Sacrament. Chriſt and the Sacrament make a rare feaſt.</hi> Therefore be ſure thou look out for Chriſt; Reſt not in the bread and wine, but look farther. When thou ſitteſt at the Table, let
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:172730:178"/>the ſpeech of thine heart be, <hi>Saw ye him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> Turn to God and ſay as they to <hi>Philip, Sir, I would fain ſee Jeſus; Lord I would fain ſee Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let neither word nor prayer nor elements, nor all things content thee without Chriſt. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> told his Father; <hi>Father, behold here is the wood and the fire, but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering?</hi> So do thou look up to thy Heavenly Father; <hi>Father, behold here is the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and here is the Scripture, here is the bread and here is the wine, but where is the body and blood of my Saviour? Lord where is the Lamb for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Father, Father, Where is the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World?</hi> If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that are preſent at the Sacrament, ſhould ſpeak to thee, give them occaſion for the ſame language, which they gave the Woman at the Sepulchre, <hi>We know whom thou ſeekeſt, thou ſeekeſt Jeſus which was Crucified: come ſee the place where the Lord lay.</hi> Come <hi>ſee the promiſe, ſee the elements in which the Lord lyeth,</hi> Mat. 28.5, 6.</p>
               <p>If the Spirit of God ſeeing thee ſo eager and earneſt for a ſight of Chriſt, ſhould put by the hangings, behind which the Lord Jeſus hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (purpoſely to be ſought) and preſent him to thee with his glorious retinue of graces and comforts, with the precious fruits of his grievous paſſion, and beſpeak thee thus, <hi>Chear up poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, behold the Lamb of God; Behold King Jeſus with the Crown of thorns, wherewith his foes crowned him in the day that he was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with greifs.

They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt could now no longer abſent himſelf; he heard the voice of her weeping, and gave her a gracious meeting: <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>Rabboni,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mary.</hi> Now her heart cleaves to him, and her hands claſp about him; and ſhe hears that golden Meſſage, <hi>Go to my brethren, and tell them, I go to my Father, and your Father:</hi> So when thou comeſt to the Table, and ſeeſt the linnen, and not the Lord Jeſus, be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; O dart up thy complaints to Heaven, <hi>Lord, I came not to ſee the linnen, I came not for the bread and wine, I came to ſee Jeſus Chriſt: O Lord! what

O, what wilt thou give me, if I go from thy Table Chriſtleſs!</hi> Thou mighteſt be confident that Jeſus Chriſt would hear ſuch ſighs, and would haſten away to bleſs and kiſs thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith muſt <hi>look up to Chriſt for grace:</hi> Look up to Chriſt as a Treaſury of grace, for the ſupply of all thy neceſſities, and put thy <hi>hand of faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Treaſury, and thou ſhalt take out <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches.

The bleſſed Saviour is a precious and deep mine; but faith is the inſtrument whereby we dig the gold out of it. As the Spaniſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſaid of his Maſters Treaſury, in compariſon of that Treaſury of S. <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Venice, In this, among other things, my Maſters Treaſury differeth from yours, in that my Maſters Treaſury</hi> (alluding to his Indian Mines) <hi>hath no bottom, as</hi> I <hi>ſee yours to have:</hi> For thy comfort know, that the riches in Chriſt are inexhauſtible, and his bags are bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs: <hi>He can ſupply all thy needs,</hi> Philip. 4.13.</p>
               <p>When thou art at this Ordinance, look on
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:172730:179"/>Chriſt as a Fountain running over with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life; and the Sacrament as a Channel cut out by Chriſt himſelf to convey Living Water to thy ſoul. Thou art <hi>diſeaſed;</hi> go in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Chriſt as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to heal thee. Thou art an <hi>indigent beggar</hi> go to Chriſts <hi>Door,</hi> I mean the Sacrament, with an expectation of a <hi>large dole.</hi> Do not ſit down in deſpondency (as the Patriarchs in a ſcarcity of food;) but ſince thou haſt heard there is corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> bread enough in thy Fathers houſe, ſufficiency of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, go make haſte to this ſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who is Lord of the Countrey, and hath the command of all the ſtore houſes in the Land, and will load thee with more then thou canſt deſire. Are thy wants many? he hath infinite wealth.

               <p>The Sacrament is as a Conduit, which receiveth water from the River; therefore when thou haſt brought the Veſſel of thy ſoul to the Conduit, thy work muſt be by faith to turn the Cock, and then it will run freely, and fill thy Veſſel; be ſure that thou minde the promiſe, <hi>This is my Body: This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> Thy faith will be celeſtial fire to extract the quinteſſence and ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>

Faith muſt <hi>receive Chriſt, and apply him to thy ſoul;</hi> When thou putteſt forth the hand of thy body to take the bread and wine, do thou put forth the hand of faith to receive the body and blood of Chriſt. This is one principal act of Faith, like <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> to take Jeſus down from his Croſs, and lay him in the new Tomb of thine heart; Like <hi>Thomas,</hi> put thy finger of faith into his ſide, and cry out, <hi>My Lord, and my God;</hi> Be not diſcour aged O penitent ſoul. Are thy ſins many? His mercy is free. Are thy ſins weighty? His merits are full. Thou comeſt for bread, and will thy Saviour give thee a ſtone? He took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thy ferious preparation for this Ordinance, and will he fruſtrate thine expectation at it? Did he <hi>ever</hi> ſend hungry ſoul empty away? The law of man provides for the poor in purſe, and will not the Goſpel of Chriſt provide for the poor in ſpirit? Is not his commiſſion to bind up the broken hearted? and can he be unfaithful? Why ſhouldſt thou miſtruſt truth it ſelf? Let me ſay to thee, as the Diſciples to the blind man, <hi>Be of good chear, he calleth for thee.</hi> See how he caſteth his eyes upon thee (with a look of love) as once upon <hi>Peter.</hi> Obſerve he ſtretcheth out his Armes wide to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee. He boweth down his head to kiſs thee. He cryeth to thee as to <hi>Zacheus, I must abide at thy houſe, in thy heart to day.</hi> O make haſte to receive him, and make him a feaſt by opening the doors of thy ſoul, that the King of Glory may enter in. Say to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, though I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof, yet
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:172730:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou art ſo gracious as to knock at the door of my heart, and to promiſe if I open, that thou wilt come in and ſup with me,</hi> (and then call to him as <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Steward) <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, why ſtandeſt thou without?

               <p>Truly Reader, ſhouldſt thou having mourned unfeignedly for thy ſins, now by unbeleif hang off from thy Saviour, thou woulſt much diſhonour him, and diſadvantage thy ſelf.

But ſtay O weary, thirſty ſoul but a while, and by and by thou ſhalt ſee this ſide opened, and blood iſſuing out to quench thy thirſt. O put the mouth of faith to that wound, and what

Sure I am, that this blood ſprinkled on thy conſcience, will purge it from dead works, to ſerve the living God. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bathe thy ſoul in this blood; when thou art at the Sacrament, ſay to God as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip; Here is water, what hindereth but I may be Baptized?

The Creatures (ſome tell us) follow the <hi>Panther,</hi> being drawn after her by her ſweet odours: When Jeſus Chriſt, out of infinite love, offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for thy ſins, ſurely the ſweet ſavour thereof may draw thy heart after him: <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good oyntments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Virgins love thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Chriſt, but what may well command thy <hi>love: He is the faireſt of ten thouſand: He is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely.</hi> But his bloody ſufferings for thee, and his bleſſed <hi>love</hi> to thee (one would think) are ſuch Loadſtones, that if thou wert as cold and hard as ſteel, would draw thy ſoul both to deſire him, and to delight in him: Meditate a little more on his <hi>love</hi> to thee. Publicans and ſinners love their friends who love them; and wilt thou be worſe then Publicans and ſinners? Conſider ſeriouſly, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>loved</hi> thee when thou waſt in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome eſtate, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. when thou waſt wallowing in thy blood, when no eye pitied thee, then was his time of love; he paſſed by thee, and ſaid unto thee, <hi>Live: yea, when thou waſt in thy blood, he ſaid unto thee, Live:</hi> And wilt thou not love him?</p>
               <p>Ponder the heat of his <hi>love;</hi> poſſibly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that fire may warm thy heart, and thou mayeſt reflect ſome heat back again; for indeed, <hi>love</hi> is a <hi>Diamond,</hi> which muſt be written upon
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:172730:182"/>with its own duſt. He loveth thee as a ſervant, ſurely this is a favour; for he hath thouſands of glorious Angels, who count it their honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ſerve him: To be made one of his hired ſervants, was the great priviledge deſired by the Prodigal; <hi>Ye call me Lord and Maſter, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am,</hi> John 13.13. but though this may be ſomewhat, it is not enough for him. He loveth thee as a <hi>friend: Ye are my friends,</hi> John 15.15. <hi>I have not called you ſervants, but friends.</hi> Friends love entirely, witneſs <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David: Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan loved David as his own ſoul. Friendſhip is one ſoul in two bodies,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher: This is much; but his love to thee is more then ſo; he loveth thee as his Brother: <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them brethren: I will declare thy name unto my brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.11.

Some write, that there is no ſuch love in the World, as between Foſter-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Ireland:</hi> This love is great, but his love is greater. He loveth thee as his childe; the ſtream of love deſcendeth moſt ſwiftly from Parents to their children: <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> Iſa. 53.10.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:172730:183"/>the Mother may prove a Monſter, and like the Oſtrich, leave her young to be deſtroyed; <hi>yet will I not forget thee, ſaith the Lord: Thou art engraven upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> Iſa. 49.13, 14, 15. <hi>Children, have you any meat?</hi> If not, lo here is my body. Thou mayſt ſay of Chriſts love to thee, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Jonathans, Thy love to me is wonderful, it far ſurpaſſes the love of women;</hi> for he loveth thee as his <hi>Spouſe:</hi> Men do, or at leaſt ſhould love their wives above all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his wife.</hi> But who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſts love to his Spouſe? <hi>Thou art all fair my love, thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe: How fair is thy love my Siſter, my Spouſe!</hi> Cant. 4.8, 9, 10. The neareſt affinity is <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and the neareſt conſanguinity is <hi>Siſter;</hi> to ſhew that his affection is like that of the neareſt relations. If this be not enough, Reader, he loveth thee as <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> nay <hi>above himſelf;</hi> he did, as it were, hate himſelf out of love to thee. He <hi>denied</hi> himſelf, <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> himſelf, and <hi>gave</hi> himſelf to be buffeted, ſcourged, condemned, wracked, crucified, and to be a ſacrifice for thy ſins. Well, is it poſſible for thee to read of this infinite love without love! When wood hath been laid a ſunning, it takes fire preſently: Haſt not thou been ſo fitted by the warm hot beams of this Sun, that now upon the very thoughts of Chriſt, thou art all in a flame! Truly it would be as great a miracle for thee to be in ſuch a furnace of love, and not fired with love to him, as for the three Worthies in <hi>Daniel</hi> to be
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:172730:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the midſt of the fiery furnace and not burnt. Chriſt loved thee ſo unſpeakably as thou haſt read, as a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> as a <hi>friend,</hi> as a <hi>brother,</hi> as a <hi>childe,</hi> as a <hi>wife,</hi> as <hi>himſelf,</hi> nay <hi>above himſelf,</hi> &amp; all this when thon waſt a <hi>ſinner, without ſtrength,</hi> yea his <hi>enemy</hi> (which three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold gradation the holy Ghoſt taketh ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8, 10.) and wilt thou ever give him cauſe to complain of thee, as <hi>Paul</hi> of his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, the more I love, the leſs I am beloved!</hi> Love him dearly, love him entirely, love him above all, love him more then all; ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of love;</hi> and with holy <hi>Brandford,</hi> ſprinckle thy tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, thy food with tears, that thou canſt love ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſo lovely a Saviour no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When thou art at the Table, <hi>Exerciſe repentance;</hi> what ſorrow for, and anger againſt thy ſins ſhould the ſight of a crucified Saviour cauſe? Some tell us that if the murderer be brought near and touch the body ſlain by him, it bleeds afreſh. O when thou (who art indeed the murderer of the Son of God) doſt touch and taſte his body and blood, ſhouldſt not thou fall a bleeding, a weeping a freſh; Behold his broken, bleeding body with an eye of faith, and thine eye cannot but affect thine heart with grief: I am confident thou canſt not ſee it with dry eyes. Was his ſoul exceeding ſorrowful, heavy even unto death for thy ſake, and is not thine, friend for thy ſins? Did he drop ſo much blood, and canſt thou drop never a tear? the very rocks were rent at his ſufferings, and is thy heart harder then thoſe ſtones? Is it poſſible for the head to be ſo
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:172730:184"/>pained and peirced, and the members not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it? ſurely, <hi>Deep</hi> calleth unto <hi>Deep.</hi> Deep ſufferings in Chriſt, for deep ſorrow in thee, O Chriſtian. If his body were broken to let his blood out, thy ſoul may well be broken to let it in. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have peirced, and mourn for him as one that mourneth for his onely Son.</hi> Zach. 10.12.</p>
               <p>His love may make (as <hi>Davids</hi> kindneſs) even a <hi>Saul</hi> to lift up his voice and weep. It is ſo great and ſo hot a fire, that (one would think) it would diſtil water out of thee, wert thou never ſo dry an herb; When Chriſt ſat at Supper in the Phariſees houſe, <hi>Mary</hi> waſhed his feet with her tears. When Chriſt and thy ſoul are ſupping together, thou mayſt well weep in remembrance of thy unkindneſs and wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>But the cheifeſt reaſon why I mention repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance now to be exerciſed, is not ſo much for thy contrition or ſorrow for ſin (though when the ſweet ſauce is a little ſharp with Vinegar, the meat will relliſh the better for it) as for thine <hi>indignation and anger againſt ſin;</hi> When thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt that thy deareſt Saviour in a cold night lay groveling on the ground all over in a bloody ſweat, that thy beſt friend in the World was ſo inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, ſo barbarouſly but chered, thou ſhouldſt cry out (as <hi>David</hi>) in a holy paſſion, <hi>As the Lord liveth, the (man, the) ſin that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> When <hi>Antonius</hi> (after <hi>Caeſar</hi> was Murdered in the Senate houſe) brought forth his Coat all bloody, cut, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:172730:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>and laying it open to the view of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaid, <hi>Look here is your Emperors Coat; and as the bloody-minded Conſpirators have dealt by it, ſo have they dealt with</hi> Caeſars <hi>body;</hi> Upon this they were in an uprore, and cryed out to ſlay the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and took Brands, and ran to the Houſes of the Conſpirators, and burnt them down to the ground, and as they apprehended the Murderers put them to death. Reader, thou ſeeſt at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the wounds and blood of thy bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the dreadful painful death which thy Soveraign underwent. O what canſt thou do leſs then vow to be revenged on his Murderers, thy corruptions; and in an holy anger, endeavour their ſpeedy execution: if thou wouldſt have a full ſight of ſins filth and ſinfulneſs, go to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and behold thy Saviour hanging upon the Croſs, and good Lord what thoughts wilt thou have of thy luſts! Phyſitians in unſeemly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, adviſe their Patients to look into a glaſs, that beholding their deformity, they may ſtrive the more againſt it. The world never had ſuch a glaſs as the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſins loathſom, ugly features, and its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, hideous, helliſh face; now how ſhould this light provoke thee to loath and hate ſin! O what Child would not abhor thoſe weapons which murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deareſt Father!</p>
               <p>It was the glory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that as ſoon as ever he had opportunity, he ſlew the Murderers of his Father, upon his fathers Tomb. Truely Reader a Sacrament day is a ſpecial opportunity, and thou

Now thou art at the Table, think of thy unthankfulneſs, ambition, hypocriſie, covetouſneſs, irreligion, and infidelity, and the reſt, how theſe crucified <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> and reſolve through the ſtrength of Chriſt, that theſe <hi>Hamans</hi> ſhall be all hanged, that theſe ſins ſhall be condemned and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:172730:185"/>is made for laughter, and wine rejoyceth the heart of man.</hi> Friend, is not this a rare feaſt? where is thy chearful face? Is not here good wine, a cup of Nectar indeed, the blood of the Son of God? what mirth, what muſick haſt thou to this <hi>Banquet of Wines?</hi> Antiently it was the beginning and ending of Letters, <hi>Gaudete in Domino, Rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> It will be an excellent concluſion of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to rejoyce in the Lord. <hi>O let thy ſoul mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſie the Lord, and thy ſpirit rejoyce in God thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> Luk. 1.46, 47.</p>
               <p>The cup in the Sacrament is called the <hi>Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cup,</hi> or the <hi>cup of bleſſing;</hi> let it be ſo to thee. Let thy heart and mouth ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath viſited and redeemed his people,</hi> Luk. 2.</p>
               <p>Canſt thou think of that infinite love which God manifeſted to thy ſoul without <hi>Davids</hi> return, <hi>VVhat ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits!</hi> His heart was ſo ſet upon thy ſalvation, His Love was ſo great to thy ſoul, that he delighted in the very death of his Son, becauſe it tended to thy good. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. <hi>Valde delectatus eſt, Junius</hi> reads it, <hi>He was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly delighted in it.</hi> Surely the mind of God was infinitely ſet upon the recovery of loſt ſinners, in that (whereas other Parents (whoſe love to their children in compariſon of his to Chriſt, is but as a drop to the Ocean) follow their children to their graves with many tears, eſpecially when they dye violent deaths) he delighted exceedingly in the barbarous death of his onely Son, in the bleeding
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:172730:186"/>of the head, becauſe it tended to the health and eternal welfare of the members: Friend, what manner of love hath the father loved thee with? He gave his own Son to be apprehended, that thou mighteſt eſcape; his own Son to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thou mighteſt be acquitted; his own Son to be whipped and wounded, that thou mighteſt be cured and healed; yea his own Son to dye a ſhameful, curſed death, that thou mighteſt live a glorious, bleſſed life for ever. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will to men.</hi> Alaſs how unworthy art thou of this ineſtimable mercy. Thou art by nature a child of wrath as well as others, and hadſt been now wallowing in ſin with the worſt in the World, if free grace had not renewed thee, nay thou hadſt been roaring in Hell at this hour, if free grace had not repreived thee. Thy conſcience will tell thee that thou doſt not deſerve the bread which ſpringeth out of the earth, and yet thou are fed with the bread which came down from heaven; with Angels food. O infinite love! Mayſt not thou well ſay with <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi> to <hi>David. VVhat is thy ſervant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead dog as I am? For all my fathers houſe were as dead men before my Lord, yet didſt thou ſet thy ſervant among them that did eat at thine own Table; Lord, I was a loſt, dead, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinner before thee, liable to the unquenchable fire, and yet thou haſt been pleaſed to ſet me among them that eat at thine own Table, and feed on thine own Son.

As <hi>Elkanah</hi> gave to <hi>Peninnah</hi> and to all her ſons and Daughters portions, <hi>but to Hannah he gave a worthy portion, becauſe he loved her;</hi> So God giveth others outward portions, ſome of the good things of this life; but to thee O Chriſtian, he giveth a <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins meſs, his image, his ſpirit, his ſon, himſelf, a worthy portion, a goodly heritage, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others have a little meat, and drink, and wages, but thou haſt the <hi>inheritance.</hi> Others, like <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi> younger Sons have ſome Cities, ſome ſmall matters given them, but thou like the <hi>firſt born,</hi> haſt the Kingdom, the <hi>Crown of glory;</hi> others feed on bare elements, thou haſt the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> others ſtand without doors, and thou art admitted into the preſence Chamber; others muſt fry eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in Hell flames, and thou muſt enjoy <hi>falneſs of joy for evermore. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that choſe thee before the foundation of the World, for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that called thee by the word of his grace, for his mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To him that gave his onely Son to dye for thy ſins, for his mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To him that entred into a Covenant of grace with thee, for his mercy endureth for ever.

               </p>
               <p>Remember the poor on that day; Gods bounty to thee in ſpirituals, may well provoke thy mercy to others in carnals. The Jews at their Paſſover releaſed a Priſoner in remembrance of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage. Surely at the Lords Supper, when thy heart is warmed with Gods compaſſion to thee, thy hand ſhould be enlarged in contribution to the poor, in remembrance of thy redemption out of ſlavery to ſin and Satan. The Primitive Chriſtians had their collections for the poor, and the Lords Supper, both on a day, <hi>On the firſt day of the week:</hi> Becauſe the Saints like the wall being then heated by the Sun, ſhould reflect that heat on the paſſengers, on others, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.

               <p>All Nations have had their ſeaſons for Sacrifice, even the <hi>Heathen</hi> who worſhipped dumb Idols, had their Feſtivals and Holy days. It is reported of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would on a Sabbath Day lay aſide his Wordly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and go into the Capitol to Worſhip his gods. Among thoſe that acknowledge the true God, the Turks have their <hi>Stata tempora, ſet times of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nay, they have their <hi>Fryday</hi> Sabbath.</p>
               <p>But to keep the Lords Day upon a conſcientious ground, and in a religious manner, is peculiar to the true Chriſtian. In the primitive times, the obſervation of this day was eſteemed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſign of a Saint. Indeed our Sanctification of it, is by God himſelf counted a ſign <hi>that he hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us,</hi> Exod. 31.13.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that God hath fenced this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with more hedges then ordinary, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our excurſions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is markt with a <hi>Memento</hi> above other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy;</hi> partly, becauſe of our forgetfulneſs; and partly, becauſe of its concernments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its delivered both <hi>Negatively,</hi> and <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. It hath <hi>more Reaſons</hi> to enforce it then any other Precept; Its <hi>Equity,</hi> Gods <hi>Bounty,</hi> His own <hi>Pattern,</hi> and the Days <hi>Benediction.</hi>

               <p>It is conſiderable alſo, that it is more repeated then other of the Commands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.31. &amp; 14.34. and 24.35. &amp; 1.19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.28.30.</p>
               <p>God would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> know,

               <p>On the Lords Day we go into Gods Sanctuary, and his pleaſure is, that we reverence his Sanctuary, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.30. The Jews indeed made a great ſtir about their outward reverencing the Temple:
<note place="margin">Willet in loc.</note> They tell us, they were not to go in with a ſtaff, nor ſhoes, nor to ſpit in it, nor when they went away, to turn their backs upon it, but go ſideling, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. but certainly Gods meaning is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, that we do with inward reverence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs worſhip him in his Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Reader, I deſire thee to take notice, that the more holy any action is, the more heedful thou oughteſt to be about it: Upon which account, the duties of this day require extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; for they have a <hi>double die</hi> of holineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are double gilt: Thy <hi>task</hi> on that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:172730:195"/>day, or the exerciſes thereof, are of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and ſo is the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>day:</hi> Thou haſt Gods hand and ſeal to the duties, he commands thee to pray, hear, ſing, meditate, receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and thou haſt alſo Gods hand and ſeal to the day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. It is conſiderable, that in the fourth Command, God doth not ſay, <hi>Remember the ſeventh day, to keep it holy;</hi> but, <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy;</hi> this <hi>Zanchy</hi> takes great notice of: further, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or a ſeventh, is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; ſo then the morality of that Command is one day of even. The Jews ſeventh day was buried in <hi>Chriſts</hi> grave, though its ſhadow walked a little while after. Take heed how thou obſerveſt this day, Gods eye is very much <hi>upon thy behavior</hi> in his houſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Tabernacle, the place of <hi>publike worſhip,</hi> it was commanded,
<note place="margin">Ne putes te in domo Dei male poſſe converſari, &amp; occultari. Oleaſter.</note> 
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt make ſeven lamps, and they ſhall light the lamps that they may give light:</hi> to teach us, that nothing there eſcapes his ſight, for in his houſe there is always light: His eye beholds all thy commiſſion of evil, and all thine omiſſion of good there: In his Sanctuary thou canſt not ſin in ſecret; there are ſeven Lamps to diſcover thy miſcarriages in the Lords houſe, and therefore it behoves thee to be very pious in that place. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the Temple was built, and became heir to the Tabernacle, as that ſucceeded this in the Celebration of Gods Worſhip, ſo alſo in Gods obſervation of all the works done there: <hi>Mine eye</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall be there perpetually,</hi> 1 Kings 9.3. There is a threefold eye of God preſent in the Aſſemblies of his people.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:172730:195"/>1. There is the <hi>eye of obſervation and inſpection:</hi> God ſeeth what uprightneſs and ſeriouſneſs there is in thy prayers and performances; God eyeth and takes notice, what integrity and fervency thou haſt in thy ſervices and ſacrifices: <hi>Mine eyes are upon all their ways,</hi> Jer. 16.17. Whether thou art praying, or reading, or hearing, or ſinging, his eye is upon thee; and whether thou perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy duties ſlothfully and ſluggiſhly, or duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently, he obſerveth thee: <hi>His eyes behold, and his eye-lids try the children of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>the eye of favour and benediction:</hi> Gods eye can convey a bleſſing as well as his hand: I <hi>will ſet mine eyes upon them for good,</hi> Amos 9.4. And Gods eye can ſpeak his good will as well as his heart: <hi>Mine eye and my heart ſhall be there;</hi> that is, in my houſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.16. The affection of the breaſt is ſeen at the brows, <hi>Mine eye ſhall be upon the faithful of the Land,</hi> Pſal. 101.6. Gods eye is in his houſe, to approve and bleſs thee, if thou ſanctifie him in Ordinances. Friend, keep the Lords Day with care and conſcience, perform thy duties with ſuitable graces, and Gods eye will be upon thee, thou ſhalt ſee his love in his pleaſant and gracious looks. Jeſus Chriſt beholds and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the gracious performances of his people; he ſeems to ſay to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, Though</hi> I <hi>am abſent from you in the fleſh, yet am</hi> I <hi>preſent with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding your order,</hi> Col. 2.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the eye of <hi>fury and indignation:</hi> Gods looks will ſpeak his anger, as well as his
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:172730:196"/>blows: His fury is viſible by his frowns; <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon them for evil.</hi> Gods ſight can wound as deeply as his Sword. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of him, <hi>He ſharpneth his eyes upon me,</hi> Job 16.9. Wilde Beaſts when they fight, whet their eyes, as well as their teeth. An Enemy enraged, looks on his Antagoniſt, as if he would look through him. <hi>He ſharpneth his eyes upon me,</hi> as if he would ſtab me to the heart with a glance of his eye; ſo an Expoſitor gloſſeth on it. If thou wait on God irreverently, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him careleſly, and prophaneſt his Day, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Corporal labour, or Spiritual idleneſs, thou mayeſt not expect his eye of favour, but of fury: <hi>If ye will not hearken unto me, to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sabbath, then will I kindle a fire, which ſhall devour the Palaces of Jeruſalem, and none ſhall quench it,</hi> Jerem. 17. <hi>ult.</hi> Ezek. 22.26, 31. Gods ſeverity hath been remarkable on the Prophaners of his Sabbath. The firſt blow given the German Churches, was on the Lords Day, which they careleſly obſerved; on that day <hi>Prague</hi> was loſt. When men diſturb Gods reſt, God doth uſually deprive them of reſt. The <hi>day of the Lord</hi> is like to be a dreadful day to them that deſpiſe <hi>the Lords Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly God is as jealous in his Courts under the Goſpel as he was under the Law. Chriſt, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, walks in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks throughout the World; He obſerves how holy duties are performed, and how his holy day is ſanctified; <hi>When two or three
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:172730:196"/>are gathered together in his name, he is in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18.20. He is in the midſt of us, to behold our inward and outward carriage in his Courts; he obſerveth in praying, what confeſſions are made of ſin, with what confuſion of face, and contrition of heart, what petitions are put up for grace and pardon, with what integrity of ſpirit, and fervency of affection. He obſerveth in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether men hear with attention ſutable to that word which is able to ſave their ſouls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men receive the truth in the love of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they reſolve on ſubjection, and to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to that form of Doctrine which is given down to them, or whether men hear Sermons as Children turn over books meerly for the gays that are in them; <hi>He goeth down into the garden of Nuts, to ſee the fruits of the Valley,</hi> Cant. 6.11. He ſeeth the rotten bough of Hypocriſie, the leaves of profeſſion, without the fruits of an anſwerable converſation, He ſeeth all thine unripe, ſowre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted duties.</p>
               <p>Reader, If I were to counſel thee how to ſpend a <hi>Market day ſo,</hi> that thou mighteſt gain much wealth and treaſure, I doubt not but thou wouldſt hearken to me; I am now to adviſe thee how to ſpend the Lords day, <hi>the Market day for thy ſoul,</hi> ſo, that thou mayſt get the true treaſure, durable riches and righteouſneſs; I pray thee to hear and obey the directions which I have to deliver thee from the Lord, for that end.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Make preparation for the day.</hi> There is ſcarce any work which admits of any conſiderable
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:172730:197"/>perfection, but require ſome previous preparation. In works of nature, the ground muſt be dunged, dreſſed, plowed, harrowed, and all to prepare it for the ſeed. In works of Art the Muſitian tuneth his Viol, ſcrewing up ſome of his ſtrings higher, letting ſome down lower, as occaſion is, and all to prepare it for his leſſon, and indeed without this he would make but ſad M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Truely Friend thus it is with us in matters of higher moment; hearts, like ſoil, muſt be prepared for the ſeed of the Word (how many a Sermon hath been loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was wanting!) and the Viols of our ſouls muſt be tuned to praiſe God, or otherwiſe they will ſound but harſhly in his ears.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts were to waſh in the Laver, when they went into the Tabernacle, and when they came near to the Altar to Miniſter upon pain of death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.19, 20. Signifying that to holy performances there is required holy prepartion; Sutable to which is <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſs thine Altar,</hi> Pſa. 26.</p>
               <p>When the Temple was to be built, the ſtones were hewn, and the timber ſquared and fitted, before they were brought to the place where the Temple ſtood; there was neither ax, nor ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor any uſe of them in the Temple: And what doth this ſpeak, but that the Chriſtian muſt be polliſhed and prepared to be a ſpiritual Temple, an habitation for the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and alſo fitted for his worſhip, which was then in the Temple.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:172730:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>There is no duty but requires ſome previous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti on. A little break-faſt quickens the appetite to a good dinner; duty fits the heart for duty; Conſider <hi>prayer.</hi> The Chriſtian muſt be poor in ſpirit, that would prevail in prayer for ſpiritual riches. The veſſel muſt be empty before it can be fil'd. <hi>O Lord, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear,</hi> Pſa. 10.17. <hi>for hearing;</hi> the weeds muſt be pluckt up before the grain be thrown into the ground; <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice and all guile and Hypocriſies, As new born born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. In <hi>ſinging;</hi> the lungs muſt be good, the inwards clean, before the voice will be ſweet and clear. <hi>O God, my heart is fixed, my heart is fixed, I will ſing and give praiſe,</hi> Pſa. 57.7. So for the Lords day, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their preparation. <hi>It was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</hi> Mark. 15.42.</p>
               <p>The preparation for the Lords day, conſiſteth partly in care ſo to order Worldly buſineſſes, that they may not incroach on the Sabbath; Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitours obſerve that the word <hi>Remember,</hi> in the fourth Command, enjoyneth a provident foreſight and diligent diſpatch of earthly affairs on the day before, that nothing may remain to diſquiet us in, or diſturb Gods day of reſt; There is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable place, <hi>If thou keep thy foot from my Sabbath,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. that is from treading on my holy ground with the dirty feet of earthly affairs, or affections. The Jews preparation began at three of the clock in the afternoon,

               <p>Believe it, thy profit by a Sabbath, depends not a little upon thy preparation for the Sabbath; till the matter be prepared, how can it receive the form, <hi>Job</hi> 11.12, 13. Thou haſt enjoyed many Lords Days, and it may be got little ſoul-ſaving good: Thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, where a table (in the preaching of the Goſpel) is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, ſpread with all the dainties of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Love, Grace, Peace, and Eternal Life, at which others ſit and feed, their Souls are fill'd with Marrow and Fatneſs, and their mouthes praiſe the Lord with joyful lips; but thou haſt no ſtomack, canſt eat little, and ſavour nothing: I dare be the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to tell thee the cauſe &amp; cure of this; the cauſe is, Thy ſtomack is foul, thy heart is unclean; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Thirdly, Conſider <hi>there is a preſent price put into thy hands, to get and increaſe grace, and therefore improve it.</hi> The wiſdom of a Chriſtian conſiſteth in obſerving his ſeaſons; the High God ſends man to School to the ſilly Ant, to learn this Art and peice of good Husbandry, <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her ways and be wiſe, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Guide, Overſeer, nor Ruler, provideth her food in the Summer, and gathereth her meat in the Harveſt,</hi> Prov. 6.6, 7, 8. The Ants are a feeble folk, but famous for their forecaſt, and deſerve ſaith one, to be fed with the fineſt of the Wheat, for the pattern they give to man. They labour not onely all day, but even by Moon-light they gather huge heaps together, lay it out a drying in a warm day, leaſt it ſhould putrifie, &amp; bite off the ends of the ends of the grain leaſt it ſhould grow; but obſerve the ſeaſon of this care and diligence; <hi>She provideth

O that Friend, thou wert but as wiſe for the bread which came down from Heaven, as this poor Piſmire is for the bread which ſprings out of the earth! Chriſtians are called Doves. The Turtle Dove is called in the <hi>Hebrew Tor,</hi> of the Original <hi>Tur,</hi> and thence comes our Latin <hi>Turtur,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to obſerve or ſearch, for ſo this Bird obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth her time of going and coming, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. for ſhe departeth before Winter into ſome warm climate. The Lords day is the <hi>Summer,</hi> thine <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time;</hi> Labour now for Chriſt and grace, or thou art loſt for ever. The Farmer that loyters at other times, will work hard and ſweat in <hi>Harveſt.</hi> If he do not reap then, he knows he can never pay his rent and feed his Family, but is ruined. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if thou doſt not on a Lords day gather in grace, how wilt thou do to lay out grace in the week days? nay how wilt thou do to ſpend grace upon a dying bed, when thou art to ſtep into the other World! <hi>He that gathereth in Summer, is a wiſe ſon; but he that ſleepeth in Harveſt, is a ſon that cauſeth ſhame,</hi> Prov. 10.5. The Jews might gather no Manna on the Sabbath, but Gentiles muſt then eſpecially get the bread of life.

Seaſons of grace are not like Tides, that a man may miſs one and take another. What Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, is true of Sabbaths; <hi>The poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.</hi> Time thou haſt always with thee while thou liveſt,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:172730:204"/>but the Sabbath thou haſt not always. Nay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhorter time then thou imagineſt; God may deprive thee both of time and opportunity, both of Week days and Lords days; and if thou art now ſleeping and ſnoring when thou ſhould be waking and working, what a cut will it be to thy heart to reflect upon the Sabbaths which thou haſt had and loſt, enjoyed and miſpent! <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem in the days of her affliction and of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, remembred all her pleaſant things that ſhe had in the days of old,</hi> Lam. 1.9. So Reader if thou ſhouldſt neglect to improve Sabbaths now in the day of thy miſery, or rather in the everlaſting night of thine affliction in hell, thou wilt remember thy Sabbaths ſeaſons of grace, and all thy pleaſant things which thou hadſt in the days of old. Good Lord, what a rueful woful remembrance will it be to call to mind the means, the mercies, the helps which were afforded thee to have avoided Hell, and attained Heaven, and yet thou like a fool or rather a mad man, didſt dally about them, and delay till the Market was done! Now is the time for thee to accept of grace, becauſe now is the onely time that grace will accept of thee. <hi>O that thou wouldſt know in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace, before they be hid from thine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourrhly, <hi>Eſteem the publique Ordinances the chief work of the day, and let thy ſecret and private duties be ſo managed, that thy ſoul may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, and profited by them.</hi> Duties in thy cloſet and family are of uſe, and have their
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:172730:204"/>bleſſing; but to put God off with theſe, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the publique Worſhip, is to rob God of a greater ſum, to pay him a leſſer: The Sacrifice of the Jews on that day was double; they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifice in the Tabernacle, beſides their Lambs for the daily Sacrifice. It is worthy our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Sabbath and publique Service are by God himſelf joyned together, and therefore let no man put them aſunder: <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and reverence my Sanctuary, I am the Lord, Lev.</hi> 19.30. They that deſpiſe Gods Sanctuary, cannot obſerve Gods Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon: Private duties are beautiful, and in ſeaſon every day; but publique Ordinances are never ſo lovely and beautiful, becauſe never ſo much in their prime and ſeaſon, as on a Lords Day.</p>

Here is <hi>Davids Poſition,</hi> and its <hi>proof:</hi> His <hi>Poſition</hi> is, That the <hi>Templer,</hi> or Inhabitant in Gods Houſe, is an happy man; <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chuſeſt, and cauſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Houſe:</hi> The <hi>proof</hi> of it is from the quality and quantity of the proviſion, which God makes for them that are of his Houſhold: For the <hi>quality</hi> of it, it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, but <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> which word ſignifieth, not onely the good will which God beareth to, but all the good things which God beſtoweth upon his people; Pardon, Peace, Love, Grace, every good thing; all good things are in the womb of that one word <hi>Goodneſs:</hi> Gods proviſion for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is beyond all their knowledge or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>There be four ordinary ways by which men come to the knowledge of good things; either by
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:172730:205"/>hearing them immediately themſelves, or by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay from others, or by the ſight of the eyes, or by diſcourſe of Reaſon: <hi>But from the beginning of the World, men have not ſeen, nor heard, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ear, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath provided for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. Iſa. 64.4.

So that the quality of the proviſion is beyond all exception, it is <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> For its <hi>quantity,</hi> it is to ſatisfaction: <hi>We ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe, even of thy Holy Temple:</hi> The Saint ſhall have enough of this luſcious fare to content him: Indeed the Chriſtians full meal is reſerved for him, till he comes to eat bread in the Kingdom of Heaven; but here he hath enough to ſtay his ſtomach: He is very well ſatisfied, that his allowance in this World is ſufficient. God calls him in the other World to greater work, and ſo will give him a greater allowance for ſuitable ſtrength; but God doth not in this World under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keep him.

               <p>But Reader, Where is the <hi>place</hi> of this good, this great proviſion? is it not in Gods <hi>Houſe, in his holy Temple,</hi> in the publique Worſhip? Great Princes

But where he affords them, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that they ſhould be attended: Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went often into the Synagogues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went up <hi>into the Temple at the hour of prayer,</hi> Acts 3.1. <hi>On the Sabbath we went out of the City by a rivers ſide, where prayer was wont to be made,</hi> Acts 13.23. and <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue every Sabbath, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.4. Thoſe that by their practices contemn publique Worſhip, have neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles for their pattern.</p>
               <p>One of the Jewiſh Rabbies hath a ſaying, <hi>He that dwells in a City where there is a Synagogue, and cometh not to Prayers,</hi> Merito dicitur vicinus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, <hi>is deſervedly ſtiled a bad neighbour.</hi> Beader, if thou forſakeſt the Aſſemblies of the Saints, how uſeful ſoever thou mayeſt be to others bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet thou art a bad neigbour in neglecting ſoul-ſervice.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt as he was faithful as a Son in his own houſe, took ſpecial care to provide and prepare ſuch publique ſervants, as might give every one their meat in due ſeaſon. The Miniſters of the word are his publique Officers appointed by himſelf to have the overſight of his Saints. They are both Fathers to beget, and Tutours to bring up his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They are his Stewarts to diſpenſe publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the myſteries of the Goſpel of peace. But little
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:172730:207"/>do they think, who ſet light by publique Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, what a price Chriſt paid, that he might enable and qualifie them for his Churches profit. The gifts he beſtoweth on Paſtors are not the leaſt ſign of his good will to his people. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, When he aſcended up on high, he gave gifts to men. And he gave ſome Apoſtles; and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; and ſome Evangeliſts; and ſome Paſtours; and ſome Teachers. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature, of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8, 11.12, 13. As Kings on the day of their Coronation, uſually appear in all their Majeſty and magnificence, and do ſome famous act (as of a general pardon or the like) which may ſpeak their love and reſpect to their Subjects. So Jeſus Chriſt when he rode Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly in the Chariot of his aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens glorious City, to ſit and reign there at the right hand of the Majeſty on High, gave abilities to Miniſters, endowed them with anſwerable gifts and graces, that they might diſpenſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God powerfully, and profitably, as a ſpecial fruit of his paſſion for, and a ſingular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his affection to his Church.</p>
               <p>I would wiſh thee therefore to be preſent at, and to continue to the end of publique Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>David</hi> would be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God. Becauſe a Door-keeper is firſt in, and laſt out. Friend, if thou wert feaſting ſome Noble
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:172730:208"/>perſon thou wouldſt not riſe from Table, unleſs neceſſity forced thee, before all were taken away, and thanks returned. I muſt tell thee that when thou art feeding with the bleſſed Potentate, it is much below good manners, to turn thy back upon him, without his leave and bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If thou wouldſt make Religion thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs on a Lords day, <hi>Tune thine heart to ſpiritual joy and delight therein.</hi> Holy alacrity and joy is not onely a crown and credit to, but alſo a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of Chriſtianity. <hi>The Kingdom of God conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in meats and drink, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. Gods ways are not ſo bad, but that the Travellers in them may be chearful; His work is good wages, and therefore its no wonder that his Servants are ſo joyful.</p>
               <p>Becauſe beleivers have ever cauſe of comfort, therefore they are commanded always to rejoyce, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Whether their ſins or ſufferings come into their hearts, they muſt not ſorrow as they that have no hope; In their ſaddeſt conditions, they have the ſpirit of conſolation. There is ſeed of joy ſown within them, when it is buried under the clods, and appears not above ground. But there are ſpecial times when God calls for this grain to ſpring up; They have ſome red letters, ſome holy days in the Calendar of their lives, wherein this joy as Wine at a Wedding, is moſt ſeaſonable, but among all thoſe days it never reliſheth ſo well, it never taſteth ſo pleaſantly as on a Lords day, joy ſutes no perſon ſo much as a Saint, and it becomes
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:172730:208"/>no ſeaſon ſo well as a Sabbath. Joy in God on other days is like the Birds Chirping in winter, which is pleaſing, but joy on a Lords day is like their warbling Tunes, and pretty notes in Spring, when all other things look with a ſutable delightful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made</hi> (he that made all days, ſo eſpecially of this day, but what follows) <hi>we will rejoyce and be glad therein,</hi> Pſa. 118.24. In which words we have the Churches <hi>ſolace</hi> or joy, and the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> or day of it. Her <hi>ſolace</hi> was great. We will rejoyce and be glad. Thoſe expreſſions are not needleſs repetitions, but ſhew the exeuberancy or high degree of their joy. The <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of it. <hi>This is the day the Lord hath made,</hi> Compare this place with <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22.23. and <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11. and you will find that the precedent verſes are a prophetical prediction of Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Sic. Arnob.</note> and ſo this verſe foretels the Churches joy upon that memorable and glorious day. And indeed if a feaſt be made for laughter, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.19. Then that day wherein Chriſt feaſteth his Saints with the choiceſt mercies, may well command his greateſt ſpiritual mirth, A thankſgiving day hath a double precedency of a faſt day; On a <hi>Faſt-day</hi> we eye Gods <hi>anger;</hi> On a <hi>Thanksgiving-day</hi> we look to God <hi>favour.</hi> In the former we ſpecially mind our own <hi>corruptions.</hi> In the latter Gods <hi>compaſſions,</hi> therefore a <hi>Faſt-day</hi> calls for ſorrow, a <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving day</hi> for joy. But the Lords day is the higheſt thanksgiving day, and deſerveth much more then the Jewiſh <hi>Purim,</hi> to be a <hi>day of feaſting and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a good day.</hi>

               <p>It is Gods precept (as well as thy priviledge) to make Gods day thy delight, <hi>If thou call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight, the holy of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. <hi>Delights,</hi> Tremel reads it. <hi>Thy delicate things</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Septuag. Whether thou art meditating on Gods works, or attending on Gods Word, which are the two principal duties of the day, they both call for delight and joy.</p>
               <p>If on this day of reſt thou conſidereſt the work of creation, and Gods reſt, it behoveth thee to follow <hi>Davids</hi> pattern, <hi>Thou Lord haſt made me glad through thy works, I will triumph in the works of thy hands,</hi> Pſa. 92.4.</p>

What heir in his minority, baniſht from his kindred and country, can think without comfort of his full age, when he ſhall have the full fruition both of his eſtate and friends; doubtleſs friend, <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths of the holy, are the Suburbs of heaven.</hi> In heaven there is no buying, no ſelling, no plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no ſowing, nothing but worſhiping God, communion with him, fruition of him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him; <hi>There remains a reſt for the people of God.</hi> There they reſt from their labours; If thou on a Lords day turneſt thy back upon the World, and goeſt up into the mount, converſing with, and rejoycing in the bleſſed God, what doſt thou leſs then begin thine eternal Sabbath here. Such a Lords day can be no leſs then Heaven in a looking glaſs, repreſenting truly, though darkly, thy future eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs; There is no perfume ſo ſweet to a Pilgrim, as his own ſmoak.</p>

               <p>When thou art attending on the word, truely that Aquavitae, that hot water may well revive thy ſpirit. <hi>Thy teſtimonies are my delight,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I have rejoyced more in thy teſtimonies, then in all manner of riches,</hi> Pſa. 119.24, 77. The Word of God is ſometimes called a <hi>treaſure,</hi> and what beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar would not rejoyce in a <hi>treaſure;</hi> ſometimes <hi>fire,</hi> and truly Reader thine heart is frozen, to purpoſe if this fire do not heat it; <hi>Salomon</hi> tell us, <hi>As cold water to a thirſty ſoul, ſo is good news from a far Country,</hi> Prov. 25.25.

What canſt thou ſay then? why they ſhould not be as welcome and refreſhing to thee as cold water to a thirſty ſoul.</p>
               <p>Variety of things that are excellent is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground of complacency in them. Variety of choice voices pleaſe the ear, variety of curious colours delight the eyes; variety of dainties are acceptable to the taſte. <hi>Nero</hi> promiſes rewards to them that invented new pleaſures. God hath for that purpoſe diſht out his worſhip into ſeveral and various duties, that it might be more pleaſant to us. Sometimes we ſpeak to God, ſometimes we hear from God, ſometimes we are praying for ſupply of our neceſſities, ſometimes we are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him for his infinite excellencies, ſometimes our mouthes are open to ſing, ſometimes our ears are open to hear the Sermon, ſometimes our eyes are open to ſee the Sacrament. The ſame meat is
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:172730:210"/>dreſt ſeveral ways to make it the more welcome, and ſo the more ſtrengthning to us. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves that that food which nature receives with delight, though not ſo good in it ſelf, affords bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nouriſhment then that which is more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, againſt which nature hath a reluctancy. Reader, thy delight and pleaſure in the ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lords day will help to make them more profitable to thee. Some colours which do delight, do alſo ſtrengthen the ſight.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if thou wouldſt make godlineſs thy buſineſs on a Lords day, <hi>Let no duty ſatisfie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communion with God in it.</hi> Ordinances are the Galleries and Gardens (and for that end appointed) wherein God and thy ſoul may walk together. For this cauſe they are called a <hi>glaſs,</hi> becauſe therein the Chriſtian beholds the glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. As <hi>Zacheus</hi> climbed up to the Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Tree to ſee Jeſus, and when he once had a ſight of him, he came down joyfully; ſo go thou up into the Trees of duties for this purpoſe, that thou mayſt ſee God in Chriſt; and unleſs this be granted thee, come down ſorrowfully. When men go to meet a friend at a certain place, and they miſs him, how diſcontentedly do they go away?</p>
               <p>Alas, what are the Ordinances without God, but as a Table without meat, from which a living ſoul muſt needs depart thirſty and hungry? <hi>David</hi> loved the habitation of Gods houſe, but it was becauſe it was the place where Gods honour dwelt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 27. <hi>David</hi> longed for the courts of God, more
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:172730:211"/>then for his Crown relations or poſſeſſions, or any outward comforts, but it was becauſe God afforded there his gracious preſence; Gods glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is in his Church Triumphant, but he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent in his Church Militant. <hi>My ſoul long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my heart and my fleſh eryeth out for the living God,</hi> Pſa. 84.2. His deſire was as eager and earneſt as of a longing woman with child, who is ready to faint away and dye if ſhe be not ſatisfied: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he compares his deſire to thirſt, of which creatures are more impatient then hunger. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 63.1. Sometimes to the thirſt of an Hart after the water-brooks, which creature being naturally hot and dry, in a very great degree, is exceeding thirſty; but the object of his deſire, of his thirſt, was God. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, O when ſhall I come and appear before him!</hi> Pſa. 42.1, 2. <hi>To ſee thy beauty and glory, as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> It was communion with God in his life and love, in his graces and comforts, which the Pſalmiſt ſo much longed for. The ſweet ſmiles of Gods face, the honey dews of his Spirit, were <hi>Davids</hi> Paradiſe of pleaſure, his heaven upon earth.</p>
               <p>They that come to duty meerly for duty, know not what it meanes to meet with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they neither ſee his face nor hear his voice, yet are contented, like thoſe that were born in ſome dark Dungeon, and never yet ſaw the Sun, they are well enough ſatisfied without it; but thoſe who have ſeen it, and know that that light is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:172730:211"/>pleaſant, if they look up to the heaven of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; ſee not the Sun of righteouſneſs, its no longer day with them; The true Diſciples met together the firſt day of the week, and enjoying Jeſus among them, rejoyced indeed; but they are onely glad in duties, when they had ſeen the Lord, <hi>John</hi> 20.20. <hi>They were glad when they had ſeen the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, when thou goeſt to the Ordinances of God, go to meet God in the Ordinances. As <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> go up into the Mount of duties to converſe with thy Maker. Go to view the beauty of his face when thou enquireſt into his holy Temple. When thou goeſt to prayer, let it be in hope to get thy heart nearer to heaven.</p>
               <p>When thou goeſt to hear, mind communion with him that ſpeaks from heaven, and then onely rejoyce in the word, when as the ſtar to the wiſe men, leads thee to the place where Chriſt is. It is God in the Word which cauſeth efficacy, it is God in prayer who cauſeth prevalency, it is God in the Sacrament who cauſeth alacrity, it is God in a Sabbath who cauſeth complacency.</p>
               <p>When thou goeſt to the waters of the Sanctuary, ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> at the waters of <hi>Jordan, Where is the Lord God of</hi> Elijah? <hi>Where is the God and Father of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Why is thy Chariot, O Son of righteouſneſs ſo long a comming! Why tarry? what clogs the wheels of thy Chariot? O when wilt thou come unto me,</hi> Pſa. 101.2. When thou comeſt from the Ordinances, and haſt not met God in them, though thou haſt ſhewed never ſo great parts or gifts, or outward devotion, ſay as <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:172730:212"/>All this avails me nothing, ſo long as I may not ſee the Kings face.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28 15.</note> Saul</hi> himſelf was ſad and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>when he enquired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered him not;</hi> and canſt thou O Saint be joyful when thy beloved hath withdrawn himſelf!</p>
               <p>Look upon performances as boats to ferry thy ſoul over, and give it a paſſage to God, and take heed of going contentedly from God without God;
<note place="margin">Pſa. 43.3, 4.</note> let thy prayer be, <hi>O ſend out thy light, and thy truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to thy holy hill, to thy Tabernacle; then will I go unto the Altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy.</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Sanctifie the whole day to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> Be early up in the morning, and as late as thy body will permit at night. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they were to batter down the ſtrong holds of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, roſe up early in the morning,</hi> Judg. 6.15. Upon the Lords day thy work muſt be to batter down the ſtrong holds of ſin; riſe early, loſe no time. Do not loſe the leaſt moment (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) of this ſacred day. The very filings of Gold are of worth; The ſmalleſt part of this holy day is of great price; The word <hi>Shamur</hi> to keep (the Sabbath) <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.30. ſignifieth to keep with care and diligence as a great treaſure, of which a man would loſe none. When men beat Ginger, they will (if good Husbands) be careful that little fly out of the Mortar; but if they beat pearl, they are extraordinary watchful, that not the leaſt of that be loſt, becauſe a little of that is of great value. Reader, if thou art a good Husband for thy ſoul, I doubt not but thou eſteemeſt <hi>thy time</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:172730:212"/>in the week days at ſo high a rate that thou dareſt not ſqander it away in doing nothing, or in that which is worſe then nothing; but O what worth, what price wilt thou ſet upon an <hi>opportunity</hi> upon a Lords day? How diligent wilt thou be to improve the leaſt peice of that day? God giveth thee ſix whole days for thine own works; do not deny to him one whole day in ſeven. Let thy conſcience be Judge; Is it not unrighteouſneſs to buy by one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is greater, and ſell by another meaſure which is leſſer? when the day is conſecrated to God, as the goods of <hi>Ananias,</hi> it is dangerous to keep back any part of it for our own uſe.</p>
               <p>Do thou all the day long live and walk as it were in the other World; Make it a Sabbath, a day of reſt. 1. From ſin and wickedneſs, this is thy duty every day, but eſpecially on this day; Every ſin on a Sabbath is double, the ſeaſon is a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſin. <hi>The wicked indeed are like the raging Sea, which cannot reſt,</hi> but every day bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble up mire and dirt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. 2. From the World and the works of thy calling; <hi>Ye ſhall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you. Every one that defileth it, ſhall ſurely be put to death; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth any work therein, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people,</hi> Exod. 31.14. The Jews were to reſt from works of leaſt importance, as gathering ſticks (he that fetched in ſticks, was ſent out of the World with ſtones) and of greateſt concernment, as <hi>building the Tabernacle;</hi> and though the Chriſtian now hath more liberty, yet he hath no leave at all to pollute the day by wickedneſs, or
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:172730:213"/>to prophane the day by any earthly work which might have been done before the day, or may be done as well after it.</p>
               <p>May I not ſay to thee of this day, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi? Is this a time to receive money and garments, and ſheep, and oxen, and men-ſervants, and maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi> 2 Kings 5.26. Is the Sabbath a time for civil affairs? The Sabbath day is therefore called <hi>a day of reſtraint,</hi> Deut. 16.8. becauſe then men are forbidden all work, ſaith <hi>Junius.</hi> As none were ever loſers by laying afide their own works to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Gods Worſhip; he took care of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſafety whilſt they were in his ſervice, that none of their Neighbours though bitter enemies, ſhould ſo much as <hi>deſire their Cities,</hi> Exod 34.24. ſo none I am confident were ever gainers by inching in ſome part of their callings unneceſſarily at the end of Gods day, and by ſetting God aſide to ſerve themſelves; the very time will be a Canker to conſume their eſtates; And as they that take Crocus into their ſtomachs, bring up not onely ill humours, but that alſo which would prove good nouriſhment; So ſome have had experience that their prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods day to increaſe their eſtates, hath forced them to vomit up the whole, God hath given thee days enough for thy calling, ſpace enough to mind it in, thou needſt not treſpaſs upon his holy day, upon his holy ground. It was no ſmall aggravation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, that though he had choice of fruits, he would eat of the forbidden fruit; ſo it will much increaſe thy ſin, if when thou haſt choice of time for thy trade, thou ſhouldſt meddle with it on a Sabbath.</p>

Is a diſhonour to a workman, to make excellent peices, and to manifeſt abundance of Skill and Art, and ingenuity, and then not to have them taken notice of.

God will be both admired and magnified by his people on earth as well as in Heaven, which none can do but thoſe that ſeriouſly conſider his works; Men have been much wondred at for ſome peculiar rare works, though in them a Chriſtian ſhould look farther, even to God the Author of their skill and wiſdom.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:172730:214"/>God, in making <hi>Minerva</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and to have had her generation in his Divine brain; but alas the choiceſt peices of men to the ſmalleſt Works of God, are but as childrens houſes of dirt to the ſtatelieſt Courts of Chriſtendom. <hi>Archites</hi> was much extolled for cauſing a Dove of Wood to hang in the Air, being equally poiſed with its own weight; but what is this to the work of God in hanging <hi>the earth upon nothing?</hi> Job 26.7.

O Friend, as rubbing the Limbs with hot Oyls is a great means to recover them when they are benumb'd; ſo when thy heart is dull and dead, on a Lords day, if thou wouldſt but ply it with the meditation of the infinite love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in ſending his Son to dye for thy ſoul, it would be a Soveraign means to quicken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Brief Directions for the Sanctification of the Lords day, from morning to night.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>REader, beſide thoſe general directions which I have largely inſiſted on, I ſhall annex here ſome ſhort directions, how thou mayſt ſpend a Lords day from the begining to the end of it, as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:172730:217"/>may be moſt for the honour of God, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering thine own everlaſting good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure thou takeſt ſome paines with thy heart the <hi>afternoon</hi> (or <hi>evening</hi> at leaſt) before, <hi>to prepare thy ſoul for the enſuing Sabbath.</hi> As our whole life ſhould be a preparation for death; yet the nearer we draw to the night of our diſſolution, the more gloriouſly (as the ſetting Sun) we ſhould ſhine with holineſs; ſo in the whole Week we ſhould be preparing for the Lords day; but the more the day doth approach, the more our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt increaſe. The bigger the Veſſel is, the more Water may be carried from the Fountain. According to the meaſure of the Sacks which the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> carried to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſo were they filled with Corn by <hi>Joſeph;</hi> preparation doth not onely fit the heart for grace, but alſo widen the heart that it may receive much of the Spirit of God. Some Servants when they are to bake in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, put their Wood in the Oven over night, and thereby it burneth both the ſooner and the better. Men make much the more riddance of their work, who being to travail a great journey, load their Carts, or put up their things, and lay them ready over night. If thou art a Chriſtian, thy experience will tell thee, that after thou haſt on a Saturday called thy ſelf to account for thy carriage on the foregoing Week, bewailed thy miſcarriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; in particular, thy playing the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on former Lords days, when thou ſhouldſt have been learning thoſe Leſſons which Chriſt hath ſet thee in his Law, and haſt been earneſt with
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:172730:217"/>God for pardon of thy ſins, and a ſanctified improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the approaching Sabbath; I ſay thy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience cannot but teach thee that thy profit after ſuch preparation will make thee abundant amends for thy pains; and that thou haſt the beſt viſits, the ſweeteſt kiſſes, when thy lips, thy heart, are thus made clean beforehand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the weakneſs of thy body do not hinder <hi>riſe earlier on the Lords day then ordinary.</hi> When the Iſraelites were encompaſſing <hi>Jericho;</hi> on the ſeventh day, they roſe early in the morning; and according to many Expoſitors it was on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.15. One main work which thou haſt to do on a Lords day, is, to batter down the ſtrong holds of ſin, to conquer thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> which would keep thee out of the promiſed land; do thou riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this end. He that riſeth and ſetteth out early, goeth a conſiderable part of his way before others awake. Its ſordid to lie lazing and to turn upon thy bed as a door on the hinges (and never the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off) upon any day, butmoſt ſad and ſinfull on a Lords day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When thou <hi>firſt awakeſt, turn up thy heart to God</hi> in <hi>praiſe</hi> for his protection the night paſt, for the light of another day, eſpecially of his own day; and in <hi>Prayer</hi> for the light of his countenance, and for aſſiſtance in every duty, and his direction through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day. As thou art <hi>riſing,</hi> if no other more profitable Subject offer it ſelfe to thy thoughts, <hi>Meditate</hi> how the night is ſpent, the day is at hand; it concerneth thee therefore to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:172730:218"/>put off the works of darkneſs, and to put on the armor of light. When thou thinkeſt on the nakedneſs of thy body, how unſeemly it would be for thee to walk up and down without raiment do not forget the nakedneſs of thy ſoul by ſin, and how uncomely thou art in the ſight of God, without the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs and the graces of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When thou art <hi>dreſt,</hi> let nothing hinder thee from thy <hi>ſecret devotion.</hi> When thou art in thy cloſet conſider of the price which God hath put into thy hand, the value and worth of a Lords day, the weight and concernment of the duties therein, and the account thou art ere long to give for every Sabbath and ſeaſon of grace. Theſe thoughts, as heavy weights on a clock, would make thee move more ſwiftly in the work of the day. After ſome time ſpent in meditation, in ſome ſhort, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and hearty petitions, intreat Gods help in the preſent and ſubſequent duties of the day; After which read ſome portion of the <hi>Scripture</hi> and pour out thy ſoul in prayer. Get thy heart effectually poſſeſſed with this truth, That God muſt work his own work in thee and for thee, or it will never be done; that as the Spirit moved on the waters at firſt, and then the living creatures were formed; ſo the Spirit muſt move upon the waters of Ordinances, before they can produce or increaſe ſpirituall life. Hereby thou wilt be ſtirred up to more fervent ſupplication for, and more importunate expectation of help from heaven; In thy prayers remember <hi>all the aſſemblies</hi> of the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:172730:218"/>
                  <hi>Saints</hi> that they may ſee Gods beauty, power and glory, as they have ſometimes beheld them in his ſanctuary. Intreat God to cloath his ordinances with his own ſtrength that they may be mighty through him for the bringing in, and building up many ſouls. In ſpeciall, when thou art at prayer, think of the <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel;</hi> Conceive that thou heareſt every one of them ſpeaking to thee as Paul to his Romans, <hi>I beſeech thee for the Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the ſpirit, that you ſtrive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</hi> Rom. 15.30. Their work is of infinite weight, it is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, Soul-work, Temple-work; Not one of them but may ſay (with <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) on a Lords day, upon much greater reaſon, <hi>O I am doing a great work.</hi> Nehem. 6.3. Their oppoſition is great The Devill will do what may be to hinder them; the world hates them, their own hearts will diſtub them; Their ſtrength is ſmall, their graces are weak; Alas what can they do! O therefore pray for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After thy ſecret duties thou mayſt (if nature require) <hi>refreſh thy body</hi> with convenient food. Thy God alloweth thee to cheriſh, though not to overcharge thy outward man, I ſhall ſpeak to thy carriage about eating and drinking in the twenty third chapter, and therefore omit it here.

               <p>The Jews according to ſome, had officers at every feaſt, whom they called <hi>Praefecti morum;</hi> their work was, the inſpection of the gueſts, that none ſhould diſorder themſelves: I muſt tell thee, Gods eye is upon thee every meal, he takes notice whether thy behaviour is as <hi>becometh a Saint.</hi>

               <p>And truly friend, It behoves thee to uſe religion as a bridle in thy mouth, to hold thee in, when thou art eating and drinking. Thy throat is a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery place, and ſin may eaſily ſlip down; Its no hard matter to ſin, whilſt the thing thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is not ſinfull. How many <hi>feed without fear,</hi> and thereby fatten themſelves to the ſlaughter, <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 12. We read of ſome whoſe <hi>tables are ſnares,</hi> in which they have been caught by Satan, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Job</hi> feared his Sons had ſinned in their eating and drinking, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.5. There are more gueſts every meal then thou inviteſt to thy table. The devil lyeth in ambuſh behind the lawfull enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will certainly ſurpriſe thee before thou art aware, if thou art not watchfull. The fatal wound he gave <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt was in his throat; By getting him to eat, he brought him, and us all to die. If <hi>Adam</hi> ſtrengthned with his perfect origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purity, was yet caught with this hook; ſure I am, it concerns thee to beware of the bait: Have a care leſt the quinſie in thy throat kill thee. Satan is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile angler, thou art a poor filly fiſh; be carefull leſt he take thee by the teeth and ſend thee to the fire.</p>
               <p>God hath given thee a rule, as for his table, when thou art eating of that body which is <hi>meat indeed,</hi> and drinking of that blood which is <hi>drink indeed,</hi> ſo for thy table when thou art feeding on ordinary creatures. He ſends in thy proviſion, and he gives thee direction according to which, and no other, thou mayſt uſe it. A tenant who holds lands of his Lord, may not uſe them, otherwiſe then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conditions on which his Lord let them
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:172730:227"/>to him, If he do, the premiſes are forfeited. Now the great God, who is Lord of the whole earth, giveth his creatures to thee conditionally that thou make uſe of them according to his will revealed in his word; if thou uſeſt them otherwiſe thou makeſt a forfeiture, and mayeſt expect every moment that he ſhould take poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>For thy direction, I ſhall here ſet down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon which God giveth thee thy food. That thou uſe it <hi>ſacredly, ſoberly,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Thy duty is to eat and drink ſacredly.</hi> Piety muſt be mingled with all thy proviſion, or elſe twill be poiſon. Grace muſt ſpice every cup, and be ſauce to every diſh, or nothing will relliſh well: Water taken from the fountain quickly corrupts, and becomes unſavoury, but in the fountain its ſweet indeed. Godlineſs will cauſe thee to enjoy the creatures in God, the fountain of them, and thereby they will be pleaſant to thee.</p>

               <p>Gods bleſſing onely is the <hi>ſtaff of bread,</hi> Exod. 23.25. <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4.4. Bread doth not nouriſh us by its own power, but by Gods Word of promiſe; He can eaſily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his bleſſing, and then bread will ſtrengthen no more then chips of bords. <hi>And when I have broken the ſtaff of your bread, ten women ſhall bake your bread in one Oven, and they ſhall deliver your bread again by weight, and ye ſhall eat and not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> Lev. 26.26.</p>

               <p>Reader, God can give thee ſoure ſauce to thy ſweet meat, if thou doſt baniſh him thy Table; he can make thy meat lye ſo hard and heavy at thy ſtomach, either by <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> Job 33.20. or <hi>ſorrow, Pſa.</hi> 107.17. that thou ſhalt never digeſt it whilſt thou liveſt. When thou art at thy merrieſt meeting, he can ſend ſuch a mournful terrible meſſage (as to <hi>Belſhazer</hi> carouſing in his cups) that ſhall make thine eares to tingle, and every joynt thou haſt to tremble. He can make thy <hi>feaſt</hi> to end either as <hi>Adonijahs</hi> in a fright, or as <hi>Abſoloms</hi> ſheep-ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a funeral.

All thine eſtate is Gods; thou art but his ſervant, his Factor; he gives thee order in his word to diſpoſe it thus and thus to ſuch poor members of Chriſt, ſo much to one, and ſo much to another, and he will ſhortly reckon with thee how thou obeyeſt his directions; and if thou forbeareſt charity now, thou wilt then be counted and found as real a theif, before the whole world, as ever ſervant was that put hundreds into his own purſe which his Maſter appointed him
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:172730:233"/>to pay to other perſons. <hi>Withhold not thy goods from the owners thereof,</hi> Pro. 3.27. from them to whom it is due, either by the law of juſtice, or by the law of love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. And truly Charity is the beſt way to plenty; He gets moſt that gives moſt; He that ſoweth liberally, ſhall reap liberally.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes conſidered with my ſelf and wondred why <hi>Nabal</hi> ſhould be ſo exceeding churliſh to <hi>David</hi> as not to ſpare of his ſuperfluities to ſupply <hi>Davids</hi> neceſſities, when <hi>David</hi> had been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding civil to him as to preſerve his flocks in ſafety from the rage of hungry Souldiers; But when I marked well the ſtory, I quickly found the cauſe of <hi>Nabals</hi> covetous carriage; He looked upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Maſter of his eſtate, and not as Gods ſervant to improve it for his profit and praiſe; <hi>Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh, and give it to men whom I know not whence they be?</hi> 1 Sam. 25.11. Had he but had ſo much grace as to have called it <hi>Gods bread,</hi> and <hi>Gods water,</hi> he would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it according to Gods word, and not have denied a poor perſecuted Saint; but becauſe he counted it his <hi>own proper wealth,</hi> therefore it muſt be diſpoſed according to his own pernicious will.</p>
               <p>Reader, look upon thy ſelf in regard of thine eſtate, only as a ſervant in truſt, which thou muſt ſhortly give an account of, and then <hi>to do good and to diſtribute thou wilt not forget, as knowing that with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 3.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Thy duty is to eat and drink ſoberly. The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to us, teaching us to live ſoberly in this preſent evill
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:172730:234"/>world,</hi> Tit. 2.12. This ſobriety reſpecteth both the quantity and the quality of thy diet.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thy duty is to be temperate as to the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of thy diet. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is content with a little, <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with leſs. Although no certain proportion of food can be preſcribed to men, for thoſe ſhowers which drown the clay vallies, do hardly quench the thirſt of the ſandy hills? Neither the bodies of men, nor their ſtomacks are all of a ſize; yet this is a certain rule, for a man to eat or drink ſo much as to oppreſs nature, and to unfit himſelf for prayer, is a degree of intemperance. God gave man food to further, not to hinder him in his general, and particular calling; and ſurely they ſin who feed till like fatted horſes, they are unfit for ſervice. <hi>Turtull.</hi> ſpeaking of the carriage of the Primitive Chriſtians at their meals tells us,

               <p>Some of the heathen did very much hate exceſs, either in eating or drinking.

               <p>But how many nominal Chriſtians, in regard of temperance, come ſhort of heathens! <hi>Wo to the drunkards of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>of</hi> England (God hath a cup of red wine, of pure wrath, and theſe muſt drink the dregs therof) how doth this iniquity abound! men drink healths ſo long till they drink away their health and their heaven too?

               <p>Secondly, Thy duty is to be temperate as to the <hi>quality of thy diet.</hi> Though here no certain quality of food can be ſet down, God allowing ſomething to the conditions, and much more to the weakly and ſickly conſtitutions of men; yet in general this muſt be obſerved, that we <hi>make not proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 13.12.

Its not un
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:172730:236"/>lawful to eat dainties, but it is unlawful to ſet the mind upon them. We may receive them into our ſtomachs, but not into our hearts: <hi>When thou ſitteſt to eat with a Ruler, conſider diligently what is before thee, and put a Knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite; be not deſirous of his dainties, they are deceitful meat,</hi> Pro. 23.1, 2, 3. In which words we may take notice. 1. Of a ſuppoſition, <hi>If thou be a man given to appetite;</hi> For a man to be given to <hi>Wine,</hi> it notes his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary love to, and likeing of that liquor; For a man to be <hi>given to Women,</hi> it ſpeaks his exceſſive care and endeavour to enjoy that brutiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly pleaſure. For a man to be given <hi>to prayer, Pſa.</hi> 109.4. it ſpeaks prayer to be his trade, his imployment, the work which he chiefly minds and putſueth. For a man to be given <hi>to God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. it notes the ſoul to be wholly at Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to go when God bids him go; to come when God bids him come; ſo for a man to be given <hi>to his appetite,</hi> it implyeth that all his projects are to pleaſe his palate, he is a caterer for the fleſh, wholly ſubject to that ſence, altogether at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of his appetite; our appetites are given to us, but we muſt not be given to our appetites; as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> who was ſerved in at on meal with 7000. Fiſh, and 5000. Fowles: And 2. here is an impoſition, <hi>Be not beſirous of his dainties;</hi> this is a diſſwaſion from the former irregular affection. We may eat and <hi>digeſt dainties,</hi> but we may not crave and deſire dainties; God made man not for <hi>fleſhly dainties,</hi> but for <hi>ſpiritual delights;</hi> It is a
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:172730:237"/>beaſtly principle and practice, to be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of provender, as <hi>Apicius</hi> the Roman, who wrote ten books of directions how to ſet forth a feaſt with all ſorts of dainties, and its ſaid the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of his Kitchin amounted to two millions of Gold. 3. Here is a poſition. For <hi>they are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meat.</hi> The deſire of dainties is a deadly deſire. There is murder under the meat; Ordinary (nay <hi>Manna</hi> extraordinary) fare would not ſatisfie the ſweet-tooth'd <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> they luſted for quailes, but God gave them their deſire, they had fleſh and death together. Some read the former verſe thus, <hi>Thou putteſt a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</hi> To pamper the body, is the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſoul and body too; Dainties entice to exceſs. He that erreth in the quality of his food, will quickly exceed in the quantity. They that plot night and day to pleaſe the fleſh, declare publiquely that they have nothing of the ſpirit; <hi>ſenſual, not having the ſpirit,</hi> Jude v. 19. The fleſh and the ſpirit are like two Buckets in a Well, as the one mounts up, the other falls down. There is a flat oppoſition between <hi>ſowing to the fleſh, and ſowing to the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 6.7. Nay the Apoſtle is expreſs in the mention of this kind of intemperate men. <hi>They ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies,</hi> Rom. 15. All the Servants of Chriſt, are Soveraigns over the fleſh. Ordinances are ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to perſons that are ſenſual; Rain falls off, as it falls on, upon an Oyled poſt. When the waters of the Sanctuary flowed, the Miry places (that is ſenſual hearts) could not be healed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Apparel</hi> and <hi>Sleep</hi> being of leſs concernment then ſome other ſubjects, I ſhall ſpeak but little to them; yet becauſe in theſe things we muſt walk by the rule of Gods Word, I ſhall not wholly omit them. And firſt for <hi>Apparel.</hi> The Saints <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as well as his <hi>inward</hi> clothing muſt be ſacred; Spiritual Prieſts do all wear (in a ſenſe) holy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Sin may cleave to our cloaths; The Leproſie was not only in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> houſes, but alſo in their Habits, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. Some perſons carry the plague up and down in their Rayment, <hi>their Garments are ſpotted with the fleſh;</hi> with pride, and wantonneſs, and prodigality. A Chriſtian may manifeſt grace in his Garments; he may clothe his ſoul in covering the nakedneſs of his body; his Garments may <hi>ſmell of Myrrhe, Aloes and Gaſſia,</hi> Pſa. 45.
<note place="margin">Exod. 19. Numb. 11.</note> As un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law the cloaths of Gods people were waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and purified Ceremonally; ſo our apparel under the Goſpel (if we obſerve Gods Counſell about it) may be clean and pure ſpiritually. For thine help herein Reader, I ſhall ſpeak briefly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Apparel,</hi> which muſt be minded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the <hi>ſins</hi> about <hi>Apparel,</hi> which muſt be avoided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the <hi>vertues</hi> (in <hi>Apparel</hi>) which muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:172730:240"/>
               <p>Firſt, To the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Apparel,</hi> which are four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>cover our nakedneſs.</hi> Innocency at firſt was mans comely Robe, in compariſon of which the richeſt cloaths are but naſty rags; Ah how lovely did he look in that Heaven-ſpun attire! In his primitive ſplendor, the moſt gaudy and coſtly apparel, would have been but as a <hi>Cloud</hi> over the face of the Sun, or a courſe <hi>Curtain</hi> over a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Picture.</hi> But ſin cauſed ſhame, and ſhame called for clothes to cover it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. <hi>They knew that they were naked, and they ſewed Fig-leaves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and made themſelves aprons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To defend our bodies from cold.</hi> Cloaths are a great ſhelter againſt the ſharpneſs of the Air, and Weather. Some mens Coats are <hi>Piſtol-proof,</hi> all mens cloaths ſhould be <hi>Weather-proof;</hi> God knew that <hi>Adams</hi> Fig-leaves were as far from keeping his body warm, as from hiding his ſoul-wickedneſs; and therefore made him a <hi>coat of skins,</hi> Gen. 3.21. This end of Apparel is mentioned, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.21. <hi>She is not afraid of the Snow for her Houſhold, for all her ſhouſhold are cloathed with ſcarlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>adornus. Cloaths</hi> render men more <hi>comely.</hi> A decent habit is handſome, naked Ghoſts are frightful. <hi>Thoſe members of the body which we think to be leſs honourable, upon theſe we beſtow more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant honour,

               <p n="4">4. To <hi>diſtinſtuiſh Sexes and perſons.</hi> One end of Apparel is to difference <hi>Sexes;</hi> The Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the cuſtome of all Nations, do teach a
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:172730:240"/>diſtinction between the Habits of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. God himſelf in Scripture doth expreſly command it. <hi>The Woman ſhall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither ſhall a man put on a womans Apparel: for all that do ſo, are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 22.5. Thoſe that have worn the Apparel of women as <hi>Caligula, Clodius</hi> and others, have been noted for the worſt of men.</p>
               <p>Another end of Apparel is to diſtinguiſh <hi>perſons.</hi> The Nobility among the Romans, were anciently diſtinguiſhed from the meaner ſort by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments about their Shoos; As God hath made a difference among men, ſome are high, ſome are low, ſome are rich, ſome are poor; ſo doth he alſo allow a difference in their Apparel, <hi>Behold they which are gorgeouſly apparelled, are in Kings Houſes,</hi> Luk. 7.25. Robes and Rich attire become Judges, and Juſtices. They are honourable additions to their Office, and cauſe reverential apprehenſions of their perſons. The habits of men ſhould be ſutable to their conditions and honours, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Eſter</hi> 8.15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.42. As it is ſinful for men to go above their abilities, ſo it is ſordid for men to go much below their eſtates and places; ſuch draw contempt on their perſons. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> being to make a Royal entrance into <hi>Millane,</hi> there was great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made for his entertainment, the Houſes and Streets were beautified and adorned, the Citizens dreſt in their richeſt attire,

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:172730:241"/>expectation to ſee a glorious Emperor: but when he came into the City in a plain cloake and with an old hat on his head, the people would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, their eyes but ſtill asked <hi>which was he,</hi> and laughed at themſelves for being ſo much deceived.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>vices</hi> about our <hi>apparel,</hi> which muſt be avoided, 1. <hi>Pride.</hi> Pride is a moth which is ſoon bred in fine garments, but a Chriſtian will conſider, that the meaneſt apparel is natures <hi>garment,</hi> and the beſt but ſins <hi>garniſh;</hi> The <hi>pedigree</hi> of our raiment muſt be remembred to allay our <hi>pride.</hi> Our richeſt cloaths are characters of reproach; and as <hi>Adams livery,</hi> they are an implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſhame.</hi> The <hi>dim-ſighted</hi> perſon is not <hi>proud</hi> of his <hi>ſpectacles;</hi> nor he who hath loſt one eye, of the <hi>plaiſter</hi> which covereth it. When the <hi>thief</hi> looketh on his <hi>fetters,</hi> he thinketh of his <hi>felony,</hi> which was the cauſe of them; When we behold our <hi>habits,</hi> we may well be <hi>humble,</hi> reflecting upon our apoſtacy, the cauſe of them; Before the Fall, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve were both naked, and were not aſhamed,</hi> Gen. 2. ult. A <hi>murderer</hi> hath as much reaſon to be proud of his <hi>halter,</hi> as a man of his <hi>habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide the <hi>matter</hi> of our cloaths is conſiderable; We are beholden to the beaſts for them, what are they but the <hi>skin, hair</hi> or <hi>wooll</hi> of beaſts? and the <hi>fineſt</hi> but the <hi>ſpittle</hi> of the <hi>ſilkworm?</hi> Alas, what a pin is this to peirce the Bladder of pride, and abate its ſwelling? One would think if this weed ſhould grow, it muſt be like the <hi>miſcletos</hi> out of the <hi>rocks;</hi> for here is not the leaſt <hi>earth</hi> to breed or feed it, not the leaſt cauſe for it.</p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:172730:241"/>
               <p>This pride conſiſteth <hi>inwardly</hi> in mens valuing themſelves the higher for their habit, which indeed is Childiſh: They diſcover their want of wit whoſe ſpirits riſe with their garments, as the boat with the waters. The dogs that kept <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcans</hi> temple, fawned upon a good ſute; but if a man came in ragged apparel, they would tear him in peices. They are brutiſh who judge either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others to have reall worth from the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of what they wear. Pride is manifeſted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, by mens readineſs to follow <hi>new faſhions.</hi> It is no commendation to Engliſh men that they are French mens <hi>apes. A la mode de France,</hi> is moſt in the Gallants mouths: <hi>But they who borrow</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>faſhions of Egyptians, may meet with their botches and boiles.</hi> They who affected the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian finery,</hi> had with it the <hi>Babylonian fetters,</hi> Ezek. 23.15. <hi>I will puniſh the Princes, and the Kings children, and all ſuch as are cloathed with ſtrange apparel,</hi> Zeph. 1.8. God ſpeaketh of them, who in their cloaths imitated the <hi>Egiptians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Oh what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of thine hath taught thee ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? ſaid Mr Iohn, Fox to his ſon, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his travails, and attired in a looſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Hiſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divin.</hi>
                  </note> or the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> Though they were never ſo high, <hi>(Princes and Kings children)</hi> yet being vain in their habit, they were ſure to feel the weight of Gods hand; <hi>I will puniſh them.</hi> Idolaters are no fit meaſure for Gods people to make their cloaths by. The prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> draweth up an Inventory of the Ladies wardrobe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and pronounceth both a ſharp objurgation and ſevere commination againſt them for their twinkling with their eyes, and tinkling with their feet; for their lofty gate, and ſtately garb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.18, to 24. We may read
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:172730:242"/>there what ſtrange fury God hath for ſtrange faſhions. <hi>The daughters of London</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>do in pride of countenance and earriage, for exceed the daughters of Sion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Willet Hexa. in Levit.</note> Alas how many men are dreſt like <hi>Poppets</hi> in a play, and women like <hi>Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew babies.</hi> Some that are profeſſours, by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick habits (which are the covers of their ſhame) become a ſhame to their profeſſion.
<note place="margin">Prodigus eſt animi vitio re tinenda Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foudens.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prodigality</hi> in our apparel muſt be avoided. A man muſt cut his ſute according to his cloth. I mean, his apparel muſt not be above his rank and eſtate. Some men famiſh their bellies to make their backs fine; others turn their rents into ruffs, their riches into robes,
<note place="margin">Prodigi ſingulis auribus bina aut terna perdent patrimonia. Senec.</note> their lands into laces, and hang (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) two or three Lordſhips in their ears; that when they have their beſt clothes on, we may ſay of them, <hi>They are in midſt of all their wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even thoſe whoſe <hi>honor</hi> may allow richer gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then the vulgar, ought to diſtinguiſh between <hi>prodigality,</hi> and what is ſutable to their <hi>places. Alciſthenes</hi> had a coſtly cloak, ſold by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for an 120 talents. <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus had rich apparel, yet never wore it twice, his ſhoes were embelliſhed with diamonds, his ſeats were ſtrewed with muske and amber, his bed was covered with ſilver and gold, and beſet with pearl.</hi> But <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Ceſar</hi> was much on the other hand, and wore no other garments then what his wife,
<note place="margin">Sueton.</note> his ſiſter, or his daughter, made him; and being asked the reaſon, anſwered, <hi>That rich and gay cloathing was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the enſign of Pride, or nurſe of luxury.</hi> So <hi>Alaxander
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:172730:242"/>Severus,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lipſ. Exem. p.</hi> 184.</note> did always cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ordinary apparrel, ſaying, <hi>That the Empire did conſiſt invertue, not in bravery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anceſter of us all was clad in leather, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. and ſo were the Lords <hi>worthies,</hi> of whom the world was not worthy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. Though now every ſervant forſooth muſt be clad in ſilk, and for gallantry outvie their Lady. It is recorded as a peice of high preſumption, of <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Speed.</note> that when King <hi>John</hi> had put his courtiers into a new livery, he put his ſervants into the ſame; but in our days preſumption and prodigality exceed; for peaſants can be more gaudy then their Prince. The <hi>Peacock</hi> hath more <hi>gayfeathers</hi> then the <hi>eagle</hi> the King of birds.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man that dwelleth in an hired houſe, having no certain time of abode in it, will ſo far take care of it, that it may be a ſhelter to him againſt the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and poſſibly that it be neat and handſom; but he will not be at the coſt of curious ornaments or rich pictures, becauſe he knoweth not how ſoon he may have warning to be gone. Our bodies are the houſes of clay in which our ſouls dwell; we know not how ſoon death may ſeal a leaſe of ejectment and turn our ſouls out of doors; it is prudence to fence our bodies ſo well with garments, that they may be defended againſt the cold, yea to be cloathed ſomewhat ſutable to our conditions; but it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream folly to be prodigal in garniſhing our earthly tabernacles, when (it may be) this night our ſouls ſhall be required of us. Confident I am that Taylors long bills, and their poor neighbours ſhort coats
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:172730:243"/>(who have ſcarce enough to cover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) will be little for many rich mens credit at the day of Chriſt. Reader, if thou art a wealthy man, remember this note whilſt thou liveſt, <hi>That one plain coat beſtowed on the back of the poor, will become thee better at this day, and yeild thee more comfort at the laſt day, then twenty ſilver laced ones, on thy own back.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Cultus magna tura, virtutis magna incuria Cato.</note> which ſhould be ſpent between <hi>Prayer and Scripture;</hi> Theſe painted carcaſſes will tell us, that if they can but dreſs themſelves by dinner time, it is as much as they deſire.

A dying bed (if their conſciences be but awakened) will teach them to value time at an higher rate, and make them know that a commodity of ſuch worth is not to be waſted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſpeak to the vertues in <hi>Apparel</hi> which muſt be manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:172730:243"/>1. <hi>Modeſty.</hi> One end of Apparel is to cover our ſhame and nakedneſs; thoſe therefore that diſcover their naked necks and breaſts, croſs this end, and glory in their ſhame. Such <hi>women proclaim their wantonneſs.</hi> Laſcivious habits are unhandſom and unholy; <hi>That Women adorn themſelves with modeſt Apparel, with ſhamefacedneſs and ſobriety, not with broydered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly array,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.9. Modeſty is a womans ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial beauty, and a needful vertue in them that are the weaker <hi>Veſſels.</hi> As ſome tempt men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their tongues, ſo others by their attire; this the very Heathen were ſo ſenſible of, that <hi>Zalucus</hi> the Law-giver of <hi>Locris</hi> enacted, <hi>That no woman ſhould be attended with above one Maid in the Street, except ſhe were drunk; that ſhe ſhould not wear em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered nor undecent Apparel, but when ſhe intended to play the Whore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gravity,</hi> Antient men, thoſe that are in ſeats of juſtice, and profeſſors, muſt not take up every new-fangle faſhion. Cloaths of light colours on their backs will not be comely. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a child might be handſom enough in a particoloured coat, but not ſo a man. When a grave Roman Petitioned the Emperour for a favour, and was denyed, and had afterwards coloured his hair, ſhaved himſelf, and in light cloaths requeſted the ſame courteſie, he was wittily anſwered by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who underſtood the fraud, <hi>I denyed your Father yeſterday; and ſhould I grant it you to day, he might take it ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtians muſt be much guided by the credit of Religion. Whatſoever things are of good report,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:172730:244"/>is both a general and a ſpecial rule for a Saint to walk by in all ſuch things.</p>
               <p>There may be excellent uſe of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>be not conformed to this World</hi>

                  <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it; <hi>faſhion not your ſelves,</hi> I love not affected ſingularity; but I like a Chriſtian Gravity, both in countenance, carriage, and attire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another thing which a Chriſtian muſt have a reſpect to in his Apparel, and that is his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ability. It is diſhonourable both to a mans perſon and profeſſion, when God hath ranked him among the rich, for him to rank himſelf among the poor and ragged. Of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. King of <hi>France,</hi> it is written in his Chamber of accounts, <hi>Two ſhillings for fuſtian to new ſleeve his Majeſties old Doublet; and three half pence for liquor to greaſe his Boots. Ageſilaus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> was ſlighted by the <hi>Perſians</hi> for his over-plain Habit. Covetous men often pleaſe themſelves, that they are not guilty either of pride or prodigality in their Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, when it may be often ſaid to them, what <hi>Socrates</hi> told the ragged Grecian, <hi>A man may ſee your Pride through the holes of your Coat.</hi> As the Prodigal erreth in exceſs, ſo the Niggard erreth in defect.</p>
               <p>One of the Jewiſh Rabbies uſed to ſay, That men ſhould apparel themſelves below their eſtates, that they may thrive the ſooner; that they ſhould cloth their Wives above their eſtates, that they might live the more peaceably; but their Children according to their eſtates, that they might Marry them the better.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>quantity</hi> of it. Thy <hi>Sleep,</hi> Reader, muſt be <hi>moderate;</hi> but how much, or how little, thy own prudence, or piety together muſt judge. No certain time can be prefixed, though ſome general rules may be propounded. Seven hours ſleep, is by Phyſitians judged ſufficient for any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſon in health; <hi>youth requires more ſleep then age; Weak men then ſtrong men.</hi> Thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion will much help thee, if thou obſerveſt thy conſtitution. <hi>Cholerick and Melancholick bodies need longer ſleep then the Phlegmatick or Sanguin, that the acrimony of Choler may be tempered, and the concoction furthered.</hi> To the Plegmatick much ſleep doth increaſe their cold and moyſt humours, and will in time make their bodies altogether ſickly; The <hi>Sanguin</hi> are apt to wax groſs, and corpulent, and unfit for action, all which is helped forward by much ſleep. Take heed of immoderate ſleep. There is no part of our lives ſo totally loſt, as that which is ſpent in ſleep. <hi>Sleep cometh like a Publican, ſaith</hi> Plutarch, <hi>and ſtealeth away a third part of our time.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laentius.</note> Therefore the wiſe Heathen have been watchful againſt this enemy: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> uſed to ſleep with a <hi>Bullet</hi> in his hand, over a <hi>brazen pan,</hi>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:172730:245"/>that when it fell out of his hand, he might be <hi>awakened</hi> with the noiſe. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> uſed with a thread to tye the hair of his head to a beam over him, that ſo when he did but nod, he might be awakened thereby; Chriſtians have more cauſe for bodily as well as ſpiritual watchfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> was ſo far from ſleeping at prayer, that he would break his ſleep for prayer, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.62. <hi>v.</hi> 147. <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried; I hoped in thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many are the diſcommodities of immoderate ſleep. It waſteth time, a moſt precious talent, which is committed to us by God, and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for at the great day. A man aſleep can hardly be ſaid to live. <hi>Sleep is a kind of death.</hi> It injureth the ſoul, hindring it of time, robbing it of the bodies ſervice,
<note place="margin">Pro. 26.13. to 17.</note> and by blunting its tools, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling its faculties, that they become unfit for thoſe ends to which they were deſigned.</p>
                  <p>It wrongeth the body by weakening the natural heat, and filling the head with vapours, by abating the memory, leſſening the underſtanding, and by making the body heavy, lumpiſh, and in a word a ſink of diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is an enemy to a mans <hi>eſtate. Solomon</hi> diſwades from ſluggiſhneſs, from this argument, <hi>So ſhall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man,</hi> Pro. 6.11. <hi>Wealth</hi> will not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>working.</hi> They are deceived who think to have the pleaſure of ſlothfulneſs, and the plenty of labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs. <hi>The diligent hand maketh rich, but ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will cloath a man with rags.</hi> Pro. 10.4. &amp; 23.21.</p>

                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:172730:245"/>2. The <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of ſleep; In general, the day is by the command of God and order of nature, the time for watching, and the night for ſleeping. The Sun approaching draweth forth the ſpirits from the center to the Circumferent parts, and openeth the pores of the body, both which do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke to working and waking; but when the Sun departeth, the ſpirits return to the inmoſt parts of the body, which inviteth to ſleep; and beſides, the naturall moyſture and ſilence of the night, are according to Phyſitians, very conducible to ſleep: Wherefore to ſleep in the day, and watch in the night, is (unleſs neceſſity compelleth it) ſinful, and a perverting the courſe of nature; <hi>They that ſleep, ſleep in the night,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6, 7. Which may be underſtood literally of a natural, as well as myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of a ſpiritual ſleep. That <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor that turned the day into night, and the night into day, was abhord as a monſter in nature: Such perſons are great hinderers of their own health, and thereby of their outward happineſs; for ſleep draweth the natural heat inward, and the heat of the day draweth it outward, whereby there ariſeth a fight with nature, to the ruine of the body. Sleep after dinner in young perſons, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth heavineſs of the head, dulneſs of wit, defluxions of humors, lethargies, and other cold diſeaſes of the brain, and alſo palſies by relaxing the finews; Beſides it is not to be forgotten, that <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> loſt his life, and <hi>David</hi> his chaſtity, by lazing on their beds in the day time.</p>
                  <p>The moſt convenient ſeaſon (I ſuppoſe) for ſleep
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:172730:246"/>(I confeſs I ſpeak in anothers art) is ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time after a moderate ſupper. When thou haſt commended thy ſoul to God and put off thy cares with thy cloaths, then thou mayſt commit thy body to thy bed. <hi>He giveth his beloved ſleep</hi> Pſa. 127.2. <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> who commanded 127 <hi>provinces,</hi> could not command one hours ſleep, <hi>Eſter.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>ends</hi> of ſleep muſt be minded; Sleep is given us by God, not for the ſolution or weakning, but for remiſſion and refreſhing of nature; which would be not onely wearied, but quite tired out by continual labour. The effects of moderate ſleep will ſpeake its ends: Sleep will (if taken ſeaſonably, and not in exceſs) help digeſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create thy mind, repair the ſpirits, comfort the whole body: It concocteth not only the meats, but alſo the humors. By the retreating of the heat into the inner parts, the vital faculty is much ſtrengthned, becauſe the heart is abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with blood for the breeding of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>The ends of ſleep will ſomewhat direct us about the meaſure: Sleep may be followed till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions in the ſtomack and liver are finiſhed, which will be diſcovered upon our awaking ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by a ſenſible lightneſs of the body, eſpecially of the head, and the paſſage down of the meat from the ſtomack.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſpatched natural actions, and diſcovered how a Chriſtian in eating and drinking, cloathing and ſleeping, may ſerve Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

That theſe pleaſures are not ſimply unlawful, is plain; <hi>Eat thy bread</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>with joy, drink thy Wine with a merry heart; live joyfully with the Wife of thy youth,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.7, 8, 9.

Piety doth regulate, but not extirpate our pleaſures. It is a pruning-knife to cut off the luxuriancy of them, not a Weeding-hook, to pluck them up by the roots; If thy body be as one of the Fathers calls it, <hi>jumentum animae, The ſouls Beaſt,</hi> then it muſt be allowed ſome <hi>reſt</hi> and refreſhment, or elſe it will carry thee but heavily along in thy journey.</p>

A man that builds an houſe, will not make it very full of windows, for then it would be weak; neither will he make it without any, for then it would be dark.

Do as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did; <hi>He put forth the end of the Rod which was in his hand, and dipt it in an hony-comb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightned,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.27. <hi>His eyes were enlightned;</hi> A little will <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> much will <hi>ſurfeit.</hi> Though Swine lye night and day in ſuch mud, do thou as the Sheep which ſometimes fall into the <hi>mire,</hi> but haſten out of it to the pleaſant <hi>Medows.</hi> Though the neceſſity of thy body cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thee to thy recreations for a ſeaſon, yet let the neceſſities of thy ſoul and family call thee off
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:172730:253"/>from them in due time. Let thy recreations be like a Porter whom thou mayſt uſe for half an hour, or an hour, as thy occaſions are, and diſmiſs; and not like an Houſhold ſervant to dwell with thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ſo ſparing that they are ſaid to be even <hi>covetous of their time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Look that thine end in them be right.</hi> The end here will ſpeak much to the ſpecification of the act; thy recreation muſt be as ſauce to thy meat; we eat ſauce to ſharpen our appetites to our food, and to make us reliſh it the better; ſo we muſt uſe recreations to whet our ſtomach to our callings, and to make them the more ſavoury to us. As muſick to the Jews did ſtir up their minds and prepare their hearts for holy performances; ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recreations may be uſed by us Gentiles, to fit us for the ſervice of God in our general and particular vocations. The Saint by the comforts of his life may delight more in God the life of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; He may follow theſe ſtreams ſo long till he comes to the fountain of living waters; He may conclude with himſelf, If recreations by the creature be ſo ſweet, how ſweet is communion with the Creatour.</p>
               <p>The Muſitian doth not leave his ſtrings conſtantly wound up, but ſometimes lets them down, and his end is, that when he goeth again to uſe his Viol, it may make the better Muſick. The wiſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman will not always croſſ-crop his ground but lets it ſometimes lye fallow, and his end is, that ſowing upon a <hi>Tilt,</hi> he may have the greater crop: So the Chriſtian may allow his mind moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:172730:253"/>he may afford the ground of his outward man ſome reſt; but his end muſt be, that when it comes again to be ſowed, to be employed, it may be the more ſerviceable to God and his ſoul; and truly ſo by going back a little, he may have this advantage to leap the farther.</p>
               <p>O how ſordid a thing is it for men to uſe ſports meerly to <hi>paſs away their time!</hi> hence they fooliſhly call them <hi>paſtimes.</hi> Reader, art thou in haſte to have ſome part of the thread of thy life cut off, as if it were too long? Wilt thou never conſider that time is a ſilver ſtream, running along into the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of eternity, and that eternity dependeth on the ſpending of this moment of time! Doſt thou not beleive that thy jovial companions now in Hell, would give a whole world if they had it for one hour; and that when thou thy ſelf comeſt to dye, and to look into the other World, thou wilt ſay with the Roman General <hi>Sertorius</hi> (in anſwer to his Souldiers, who told him twas diſhonourable to the Romans, to pay tribute to the barbarous people inhabiting the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountain.)

                  <hi>Time is a precious commodity to be taken up at any rate.</hi> Good God, how much wilt thou think a Week, a Day, nay an hour worth!</p>
               <p>For thy ſouls ſake weigh thy time, as it ſtands in relation to thine everlaſting condition, and then I am confident thou wilt aim at another end in thy recreations. Though children go to ſchool and work in hope of play, yet men play to fit themſelves for work. Though wicked men have ſuch ſordid ſinful ends in their delights, do thou

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>have an eye to the ſeaſon of them.</hi> Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have their play-hours; yet if they be found playing when they ſhould be at their <hi>books,</hi> they muſt expect to be beaten; The Maſter that doth not grudge his ſervant time to viſit his friends, and rejoyce with his familiars, yet if he ſhould do it when his work lieth upon the ſpoil, he could not but take it very ill. God alloweth us liberty for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate delights, but it is only when our general and particular callings will give us leave. Cardinal <hi>Angelot</hi> is chronicled for a ſordid perſon, for ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the oats which his man had given his mare; how ſordid are thoſe parents who ſteal their childrens food, to purſue their own pleaſures! He that neglecteth his particular calling to follow his ſports, is like him that ſtarveth his ſon, to feed his ſwine; And he that omits his prayers and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties to mind his pleaſures, is like him that is condemned to be hanged, and hath only three days allowed him to procure his pardon in, yet he ſpends all that time in hawking or hunting.</p>
               <p>Recreations are like ſome fruits not always in ſeaſon, though at ſometimes they are very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, yet at other times they are very hurtful. The wiſe man tells us there is a <hi>time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn,</hi> and <hi>a time to dance,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.2, and 5. <hi>There is a time to weep; Sorrow,</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>ſeaſonable. Dalilah</hi> diſparaged her diſcretion by
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:172730:254"/>
                  <hi>weeping</hi> on the day of her <hi>wedding. There is a time to laugh;</hi> Delights are ſometime out of faſhion. He forfeits his credit that ſports at a funeral? <hi>Muſick never ſuited with mourning</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In general,</hi> recreations are then unſeaſonable when God and mens families are neglected; that they may be minded when to give them water, we are forced to make the Mill of our general and particular callings to ſtand ſtill. O what a fool is that voluptuous youngſter, who having no more horſes then what is ſufficient for his ploughing, will yet take one to hunt upon, and thereby cauſe the reſt to be idle, and his buſineſs to be undone! But how mad is that perſon who, <hi>Eſau</hi> like, is <hi>hunting,</hi> and thereby miſſeth the bleſſing!</p>
               <p>In <hi>particular,</hi> our recreations are unſeaſonable on a Lords day, and in times of publick calamities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Recreation are <hi>unſeaſonable on a Lords day;</hi> Carnal pleaſures muſt then vaniſh, and ſpiritual pleaſures muſt take place: Our joy muſt be pure and heavenly on that day.

               <p>When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was asked what he thought of <hi>Muſick;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Jovem nec canere, nec citharam pulſare; that Jupiter cared not either for ſinging or fidling;</hi> he was for higher and more refined exerciſes. The infinite God doth always overlook our <hi>puddle-water,</hi> more eſpecially on his own day, when he alloweth us to drink of his own <hi>richeſt Wines.

Mark, 1. <hi>The excellency of the proviſion, fatneſs of thy houſe, the River of thy pleaſures.</hi> The fatteſt is eſteemed the faireſt, and the moſt excellent food; therefore the Saint was enjoyned to offer the fat in Sacrifice under the law.

Fatneſs here is the top, the cream of all ſpiritual delicacies. <hi>My ſoul is filled as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſs; and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips,</hi> Pſa. 63.5. But though God keep ſo noble an houſe to ſatisfie his peoples hunger, what ſpecial care doth he take to quench their thirſt? <hi>Thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> O he drinks to them, and they pledge him in his own cup. Hath the Child then any cauſe,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:172730:255"/>when his father keeps ſo rare and coſtly a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to leave ſuch dainties, and go a begging up and down the Country for ſcraps and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? O how much do theſe diſgrace their Parents proviſion, and their own diſcretion? But mark Reader 2. the <hi>plenty</hi> as well as the excellency of this proviſion. Here is fatneſs in the abſtract; <hi>a river of pleaſures,</hi> and ſo much as that they who enjoy it ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and <hi>abundantly ſatisfied.</hi> A <hi>River</hi> is overflowing and everflowing, it communicates its water, and yet is never empty; It is fed with Springs and Fountains, and therefore its no wonder if it always be full; They that are at ſuch a <hi>Well,</hi> need not complain of want; but here is not onely Rivers and fatneſs, for ſome have much, and yet cannot feed; but of Gods people its ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied;</hi> in the Original it is <hi>inebriated,</hi> they ſhall have not onely a ſufficiency, but a redundancy of ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; the Veſſels of their ſouls ſhall be filled to the brim, out of that River, <hi>whoſe ſtreams make glad the City of God.</hi> Surely then, they that may have bread in ſuch abundance, enough and to ſpare in their Fathers Houſe, made of the Kidneys of the Wheat, of the fineſt Flower, need not hanker after the Worlds homely fare. Our Heavenly Father doth not keep ſo ſtarve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an houſe, that the Worlds ſcraps ſhould go down with us.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how abominable is it to diſturb Gods reſt with our ſports! Some work hard on the week

Truely if thy fleſh ſhould tempt thee to carnal mirth in aday of <hi>Zions</hi> tribulations, do thou repell it as he did; <hi>The beautiful Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, the bleſſed members of his body are in great affliction, they water their couches with tearts, and they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their drink with weeping; and ſhall I mind my play, and ſports, and earthly delights! through the Lords help I will not do it. No, by the Rivers of</hi> Babylon, <hi>let me ſit down and weep when I remember</hi> Sion.

<note place="margin">Fourthly,</note> ſo alſo <hi>in our Civil Actions,</hi> and <hi>particular Callings.</hi> The Heavenly Bodies have an influence, not onely on men and women, but alſo on trees and plants: The holineſs of a Saint muſt be operative, not onely in his more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler exerciſes, the Ordinances of God, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his earthly and inferior employments. Thy duty is Reader, to minde thy general in thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, and to drive a trade in Heaven, whileſt thou art following thy trade on Earth: When thou art called to the Lord, thou art not called from thy labour; nay, as thou art a ſervant of Chriſt, thou art bound to be ſerviceable to thy Countrey, in ſome mental or manual Calling; but thy diligence therein muſt proceed from <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> not from <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> from ſubjection to Gods Word, not from affection to thy wealth.</p>
               <p>As thy particular Calling is the <hi>Zodiack</hi> through which <hi>thou daily paſſeſt;</hi> ſo Godlineſs muſt be the <hi>Ecliptick line</hi> to go through the midſt of it: God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs muſt be the key to open the ſhop; Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be the whip to drive the Cart; Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be the Cock to call thee up to thy work; Godlineſs muſt be the clock to call thee off from thy work; Godlineſs muſt be the principle, the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:172730:259"/>rule, and the end of thy work; Holineſs to the Lord was written upon the bridles of the horſes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.21.</p>
               <p>Truly Reader, thy care had need to be great about thy calling, leſt it cauſe thy ruine: <hi>More dye by meat then by poyſon.</hi> By lawful things many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; Worldly things will court thee, that they may kill thee: They that dig deep into the bowels of the earth, have not ſeldom been ſtifled with the damps that ariſe thence. Theſe things are ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to defile and deſtroy us, that God made a Law that they ſhould not be uſed, before they were purified, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.22, 23. Some are deſtroyed by thoſe houſes which were made to defend them; like <hi>Saul,</hi> they fall on thoſe ſwords which ſhould have been for their ſafety. Particular Callings were deſigned for our good; but how often do they prove our grief? Are there not thoſe, who like <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, are ſwallowed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live of earth, and conſumed! <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves,

               <p>It behoves thee to take heed how thou handleſt theſe thorns, if thou wouldſt not prick thy fingers, and pierce thy conſcience. I ſhall for that end give thee ſome Directions out of the Word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>be diligent in thy Calling:</hi> It is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Apoſtle adviſeth the <hi>Romans, Be

As in the Body Politick, ſo in the Body Natural, there muſt be order; to which three things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, 1. That every part be in its proper place, each Star in its own Orb. 2. That the parts have each to other a due proportion. 3. That every member do its duty, and be ſome way or other helpful to the Body. Idle perſons are like <hi>Wens</hi> in the face, which receive of the bodies nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſerve onely to disfigure it. Thoſe that are <hi>no workers,</hi> in Gods account <hi>are diſorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.14. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> built an <hi>Apragapolis, a City void of buſineſs;</hi> but God made not the World to be a <hi>Nurſery of idleneſs.</hi>

The <hi>Grecians,</hi> according to <hi>Solons</hi> Law, were great diſcouragers of them, that like Vermine, lived onely to eat what others earn. The Council of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> enquired how every man lived, and puniſhed ſuch as they found idle. The Devils themſelves are diligent about their deeds

               <p>The Patriarchs, thoſe perſons of renown, were eminent for taking pains, they did not eat the bread of idleneſs: How frequently, and how ardently doth the Word call upon us to be working in our particular callings?

Students who are given to a ſedentary life, often waſte in their ſtrength, when others whoſe time is ſpent in bodily labour, increaſe in ſtrength; <hi>In all labour,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>there is profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold care mentioned in the Word of God. There is a care of the head, a care of the hand, and a care of the heart. The care of the head is the care of providence, this is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.16. The care of the hand, is the care of diligence, this is profitable, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.5. The care of the heart, is the care of diffidence, this is abominable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. Upon which words <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerveth well. God doth not ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <hi>do nothing, but be careful for nothing.</hi> The two firſt are commanded, but the laſt is forbidden. Reader, thou mayſt as well expect riches to rain down from Heaven in ſilver ſhowres, as to provide for thy family and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren without induſtry in thy calling. <hi>Solomon</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich; and the diligent hand maketh rich,</hi> Pro. 12.24. and 10.4, 22.</p>
               <p>As the nether Milſtone is heavy, ſlow, and of ſmall riddance, yet the upper Milſtone though of greater agility, and quicker diſpatch, doth not grind without the nether, but both together make good meal; ſo the diligent hand of it ſelf, can do little, nay nothing without the bleſſing of God; yet the Bleſſing of God, though of infinite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:172730:261"/>will ſeldom do any thing without the diligent hand, but both together make a perſon rich.</p>
               <p>Beſides negligence about mens vocations is one great cauſe of corruption. The <hi>proud</hi> perſon is Satans <hi>Throne,</hi> and the <hi>idle</hi> man his <hi>Pillow;</hi> He ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the former, and ſleepeth quietly on the latter; when men have nothing to do, the Devil always ſets them a work. <hi>As a Bird that wandreth from his Neſt, ſo is a man that wandreth from his place,</hi> Pro. 27.8. By <hi>place,</hi> the Holy Choſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth particular callings. Now God had taken care that none ſhould moleſt a Bird in her Neſt, there ſhe was ſafe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.6, 7. but when ſhe begins to wander, then ſhe is in danger, either to be ſhot by the Fowler, or caught in the Snare, or made a prey to other ravenous birds; So a man that is diligent in his calling, whilſt he is imployed therein, is in Gods <hi>precincts,</hi> and ſo under Gods <hi>protection;</hi> but when he wandreth abroad from his calling, going out of his bounds to ſit and talk, he is a <hi>weft</hi> and a <hi>ſtray,</hi> and ſo falleth to the Lord of the Mannor, <hi>the God of this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, thou mayſt expect to be preſerved whilſt thou art a working, but not when thou art wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of a Chriſtian woman who going to a play, was poſſeſſed by the Devil, and when he was asked by thoſe that came to caſt him out, how he durſt poſſeſs one that was a Chriſtian? he anſwered, <hi>I found her in my own place.</hi> Friend, they who like <hi>Dinah</hi> gad abroad, are often defiled before they come home. Thoſe Souldiers who leave their places in a March and ſtragle to pilfer,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:172730:262"/>are many times ſnapt and ſlain by their enemies, when they who keep their places are ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. O mind thy calling in its place and ſeaſon, and know this for thy comfort, that whilſt thou art about thy lawful work (obſerving Scripture rules in it) thou art under Gods Wing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Deal righteouſly in thy calling.</hi> Take heed of unjuſt gain; believe this truth, <hi>A clear and clean conſcience is infinitely better then a full purſe. A little with the fear of the Lord, is better then the poſſeſſions of many wicked men,</hi> Pſa. 37.15. A little wholeſome food is better then a thouſand poiſoned Diſhes. All the Wealth which is got in Gods way is pleaſant; but all the wealth which is got unjuſtly by wickedneſs is poiſon. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and bringeth no ſorrow of heart with it,</hi> Pro. 10.22. Defrauding thy Neighbour, and cheating thy Cuſtomers maketh rich, and bringeth <hi>the ſorrow of Hell with it.</hi> He that reſolveth to be unrighteous (it is commonly ſaid) may ſoon be rich. When the ſpring of conſcience is ſcrewed up to the higheſt pin, that it is ready to break, and godlineſs is locked up faſt into an outhouſe, and not ſuffered ſo much as to peep into the Shop or Warehouſe, to take notice of what is done there, ſuch a Tradeſman may gain ſilver, but alaſs he loſeth his precious Saviour, and his never dying ſoul. O what a dreadful gain is it to get earth with the loſs of Heaven! He that will be rich in <hi>haſt,</hi> ſhall be poor enough in <hi>Hell.

                     </gap> not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven! be not deceived, God will not be mocked.</hi>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:172730:262"/>1 Cor. 6.9. Do not think (Reader) though thou canſt cheat thy Chapmen, that thou canſt cozen God; no, he will not be mocked; he ſeeth thy falſe weights and falſe meaſures, which thou ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſeſt, though thou haſt others to bring forth (for a colour) if occaſion be, and he will deal juſtly with thee for thy injuſtice, by ſending thee to that place where there is <hi>judgement without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> I have read of an old rich covetous wretch, that lying upon upon his death-bed, he asked his Son whether he would not do any thing that his Father ſhould deſire him. His Son anſwered yea: then ſaith the Father, <hi>Hold your finger in the flame of that Candle an hour.</hi> Sir, ſaith the Son, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly endure that.</hi> No, ſaith the Father! <hi>I muſt burn for ever in Hell, for raking up an eſtate unjuſtly for you, and yet you will not burn a finger one hour for me!</hi> O Reader, if thou art guilty of this ſin, think of it betimes. Thy ill gotten wealth will breed thoſe wormes which will gnaw thee eternally. Beſides, thou mayſt think to raiſe thy Houſe by ſuch heaps; but God himſelf ſaith it is the way to ruine it; <hi>He that is greedy of gain, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his own houſe,</hi> Pro. 15.27. Whilſt he thinks to <hi>feather</hi> his neſt, he doth indeed <hi>fire</hi> it. It is an obſervation of the houſe of <hi>Deſmond</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That <hi>Maurice</hi> the firſt Earl of that family, raiſed it by injuſtice; and by injuſtice <hi>Girald</hi> the laſt Earl ruined it. The crafty Fox in the Fable hugd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he had cozend the Crow of his break-faſt, but when he found himſelf poiſoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he wiſht it out of his belly.

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be careful that thy particular Calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach not upon thy general:</hi> Many loſe Religion in a crowd of earthly buſineſſes.

It is reported of the inhabitants of <hi>Oenoe,</hi> a dry Iſland near <hi>Athens,</hi> that they beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much labour to draw in a River to water it, and make it fruitful, but when the paſſages were
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:172730:263"/>opened, the water came in ſo plentifully that it overflowed the Iſland and drowned all the people.

A Candle that burns well above ground, when put under ground, doth many times burn blew and go out; the light of holineſs which hath ſhined eminently in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ ors, when they have had little to do with the World, hath been abated in a great degree, when they have had great dealings. They in regard of much buſineſs, have been like thoſe in a Mill, who cannot hear what is ſpoken by reaſon of the clack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and noiſe which is made there. Chriſt calleth, and the Spirit of God cryeth to them, but their eares are ſtopt with earth that they hear not.</p>
               <p>As we ſay of fire and water, they are good Servants, but bad Maſters; Keep them within their bounds, and they are exceeding uſeful, but when they go beyond their bounds how hurtful are they? What miſchief hath fire done in <hi>England?</hi> what ſad work hath water made in <hi>Holland?</hi> The ſame is true of our particular callings, they are faithful Servants, but they are dreadful Maſters; Keep them within their limits and they are helpful to our ſelves, our relations, and our neighbours; but ſuffer them once to tranſgreſs their bounds, and they will make miſerable work; they will rob God, wrong the ſoul, nay often ruine it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.

               </p>
               <p>Now if thou wouldſt not have thy particular calling to incroach upon thy general, take heed that it ſteal not away thy heart, nor thy time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed that thy particular calling ſteal not away thy heart from thy general calling. If the Miſtris keep her diſtance and maintain her authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over her maidens, ſhe may find them obedient and ſerviceable; but if ſhe grow fond of them, and familiar with them, they will grow ſaucy and incroach upon her; Reader, keep thy inward diſtance, and maintain that authority which God hath given thee over the things of this life, and then all will be well; butif once thou doateſt on them, and delighteſt in them, expect to have them thine hinderances in all holy exerciſes; The World may have thy hands, but it muſt not have thy heart. Thy actions may be about thy particular calling, but thy affections muſt be above it. <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things below,</hi> Colloſ. 3.2. Thy occupation is as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> of the earth, <hi>carthly;</hi> but thy converſation muſt be like the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (the Lord from Heaven) <hi>heavenly.</hi> A Chriſtian ſhould follow the things of this World with ſuch a ſlightneſs and indifferency of Spirit as Wicked men do the things of a better World. The holy Angels behold our earthly affairs but as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to them. It is happy for him that can carry himſelf towards his own eſtate as if it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:172730:264"/>mans. An heathen could ſay, <hi>I do not give but onely lend my ſelf to my buſineſs.</hi> Surely then a Saint ſhould go through th World as one in a deep ſtudy,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rebus non me trodo ſedcous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo</hi> Senec de benef</note> his mind being the whilſt intent upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter object. Brutiſh <hi>Horſeflies</hi> faſten on Dunghils, <hi>Swallows</hi> make their neſts of earth. They who have no Heaven hereafter, may give their hearts to the earth; but, Chriſtian if thou loveſt thy ſoul, though <hi>riches increaſe, ſet not thine heart upon them. Love not the World, nor the things of the World,</hi> Pſa. 62.10. This is a certain truth, the hotter thy love is to the World, the colder it is to the Lord. When the ſap of Worldlineſs is in a man, he will never flame well heavenward. The Ship may ſail in the water and be ſafe, but when the water get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the Ship it ſinketh it. Thou mayſt work about thy earthly affairs and all may be well; but if thine affairs once work themſelves into thee, then thou art in danger. Thy God alloweth thee to <hi>warm</hi> thy ſelf at the Sun of creature comforts, but not to turn Perſian and worſhip it.</p>
               <p>The Riviers lightly ſalute the earth as they paſs along, and make no ſtay, but paſs forward to the Ocean. Thy affections ſhould but ſlightly touch the earth, weeping for worldly croſſes as if thou wepſt not, and rejoycing for Worldly comforts as if thou rejoycedſt not, and ſo paſs on to the Ocean of thy happineſs; Its ſaid, <hi>Germanicus</hi> reigned in the <hi>Romans</hi> hearts, <hi>Tiberius</hi> onely in the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Thy general muſt reign in the City, in thy heart; thy particular calling onely in the Suburbs of thy hands. Reader, if the World ever get into the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:172730:265"/>throne of thine inward man, fare wel all Religon. I have read of a cuſtom among the <hi>Germans,</hi> to know whether their children be baſtards or not, to throw them <hi>in Fluvium Rhenum,</hi> into the River <hi>Rhine;</hi> If they floated above, then they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them to be their own; but if the waters carried them away, then they eſteemed them as Baſtards; Truely Reader, if thou canſt float above the waters of thy worldly imployments, thou art a child of God, but if that carry thee away by lying near thy affections, look to thy ſelf and fear thy condition. It is not the greatneſs of mans eſtate or employment ſo much as the nearneſs of it to his heart which will hinder holineſs. A ſmall hat held near our eyes, will hinder our ſight of the Sun, which a great mountain a far off will not do. A little near the affections will hinder our ſight of Chriſt, when thouſands far from the heart may, as imployed, further it. Beſides the cloſer we lay the flowers of our earthly mercies to our breaſts, the ſooner they wither. A noſegay in the hand will continue freſh and ſweet; (as is generally obſerved) much longer then when it is ſtuck in the boſome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thy particular calling may not incroach upon thy general, be careful <hi>that it ſteal not away thy time.</hi> Thy piety Reader, and thy prudence is ſo to order thine affairs relating to heaven and earth, to God and thy family, that they may not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere or croſs each other. A wiſe foreceaſt will much help thee in this particular. As to the winding a skein of ſilk, he that begins at the right end, will make
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:172730:265"/>quick riddance of it; ſo to the diſpatching of Wordly imployments, that they may not prove heavenly impediments, he that hath diſcretion to forecaſt them well, may do very much. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy duty is to give the affairs of thy ſoul, and thy God, precedency. I know the Devil and thy corrupt heart will often juſtle and quarrel with thy Cloſet and Family duties, by ſuggeſting to thee that they muſt of neceſſity be omitted, becauſe otherwiſe ſuch and ſuch concernments of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (upon which the welfare of thy ſelf, Wife, and Children doth depend) will be neglected. As when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of the <hi>Iſraelites ſacrificing</hi> to God, then <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſpake of <hi>work</hi> to put them off; ſo when thou art thinking of entring upon the performance of duties, whether in ſecret or private, thy back friend (the evil one) will ſend thee a meſſage, either by thy Wife, or friend, or thine unregenerate part, that ſome other affairs of weight call for thy company elſewhere, and therefore a diſpenſation muſt be granted thee at preſent, as to thy ſolemn devotion. Friend, if thou loveſt Jeſus Chriſt, take heed of hearkening to ſuch temptations; let the fleſh but once obtain ſuch a conqueſt over thee, and thou ſhalt hear of it again, it will purſue its victory to purpoſe. Sins is a ſubtle Sophiſter, it will bring Arguments and Reaſons for all it doth; as is plain in <hi>Sauls</hi> ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the flock: The beaſts were to be Sacrificed to God; and in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves, they were ſet up to ſave the Jews thoſe tireſome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but take heed that thy heart be
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:172730:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>not hardened <hi>through the delightfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Piety is the beſt path to outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <p>He that ſtealeth away time from his general for his particular calling, like a thief in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle waſteth all; our work on earth is done beſt, when our work in heaven is done firſt.

He that neglecteth the ſervice of his God, for the following his trade, may put what he getteth into his eye (as our proverb is) and never ſee the worſe; nay like the gold of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> or the Vineyard of <hi>Naboth</hi> to <hi>Ahab, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> will be the perdition and ruine of the poſſeſſor. They who want time to do Gods Work, muſt want an eternity to receive Gods reward. If men are ſo buſie as not to attend their ſouls, God will be ſo buſie as not to beſtow ſalvation. I know, <hi>Farmes</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> do hinder many from holineſs: and I know alſo that they will hinder many from Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. That <hi>German</hi> Prince who would not part with his ſilver to pay
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:172730:266"/>his Souldiers, loſt thereby his Empire and treaſure too; He that will not ſpare time from his preſent buſineſs for his future bleſſedneſs, is like to loſe both.</p>
               <p>How much time doſt thou ſquander away in long meales, in vain ſports, inidle diſcourſe, in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ſleep, and yet haſt thou the face to tell God that thou haſt no time in a whole day to ſeek his favour, and to mind thine eternal felicity! The truth is thou doſt not ſo much want time as waſte time.</p>
               <p>Do not think that it will be a ſufficient excuſe at the laſt day to tell God, that thy devotion was neglected, becauſe thy earthly occaſions abounded and preſſed upon thee. If thy ſervant ſhould tell thee, when he hath neglected thy buſineſs of concernment, that he could not help it becauſe he had buſineſs of his own to look after, a Friend called him to the Ale-houſe, wouldſt thou think that a ſufficient plea? Beleive it, thy defence is far worſe when thou omitteſt the ſervice of God for thy particular calling.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher could ſay,

               <p>A Good Chriſtian if buſineſs crowd in upon him ſo much, that he cannot wait on them, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:172730:267"/>God daily in his Cloſet and Family as he ought, will rather like a wiſe Marriner (when the ſhip is overburdened) caſt ſome overboard, then endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the loſs of all and himſelf too. Times of earing and harveſt were very buſie times with the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> yet then God would not allow them to make bold with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.21.</p>
               <p>He that is a faithful and wiſe Steward, will give every one their portion, their meat in due ſeaſon; as he will give his body and his family their portion every day, ſo he will give his God and his ſoul their portion every day; ſurely he is not faithful who atteneth the <hi>lacquey</hi> all day, and neglecteth his Lord; much worſe is he who feedeth his fleſh and ſtarveth his ſpirit. Reader take notice that there <hi>is a time for all things;</hi> as there are plowing times, ſo there are praying times every day; as there is daily time for thy ſhop, ſo alſo for thy Cloſet. When the Jewiſh daily ſacrifice was intermitted as in the days of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> it was the <hi>abomination of deſolation</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the larger in this particular, as obſerving that profeſſours are exceeding faulty in ſuffering the Canker of their particular callings to devour and eat up the gold and ſilver of their general cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Sometimes they will wholly omit family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe the world will not permit them to be at leiſure, but too too often when they perform them, they turn them off with a ſhort cut, in a hudling manner, (as a Phyſitian his poor patients, though their buſineſs with him concern their lives, when rich men ſtand without, expecting to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in) becauſe the World ſtayeth at their doors to
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:172730:267"/>ſpeak with them. Friend, as a ſpecial help againſt this ſoul-hinerance, let me perſwade thee to be early in the morning at thy Religious duties. Some men muſt be ſpoke to betimes in the morning, or not at all; their publique affairs take up the whole day, and would if it were twice as long. The Devil hath a thouſand divices to make him an Athieſt all day, who neglecteth morning duties. Be not ſo haſty about thy calling in the morning, as to forget to take God along with thee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this one note, <hi>If the World gets the ſtart of Religion in the morning, religion ſeldom overtaketh it all day.</hi> Something warm in the morning, before men go to work is very wholeſom. A warm prayer, warm communion, with the bleſſed God, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating or reading, will help thee to work with more comfort and courage, and may prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from ill fumes and vapours in the day time. <hi>Job</hi> had a large family, much Cattel; he had beſides his domeſtical, much civil buſineſs, for he was a Magiſtrate;
<note place="margin">Job 1.5.</note> yet <hi>Job roſe up early in the morning to offer up Sacrifice, and thus did Job continually.</hi> In the day time alſo, or at evening, let nothing put by the concernments of thy God, and thine everlaſting eſtate; what company ſoever thou art in, ſay as a devout ſoul I have read of, when his hour of prayer was come, <hi>you muſt excuſe me, I muſt be gone, a friend</hi> (meaning his God) <hi>ſtayeth to ſpeake with me.</hi>

<pb n="484" facs="tcp:172730:268"/>ſoever thou haſt been all day long about thy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I muſt tell thee (though an hour cannot be bought with the revenues of the whole earth) <hi>Thou haſt ſpent a whole day idly, and</hi> thou haſt much cauſe to ſigh out with the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour at night when he had neither done norreceived any good all day, <hi>Hodie diem perdidi, Today I have loſt a day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If thou wouldſt exerciſe thy ſelf to godlineſs in thy particular calling, <hi>look up to God for a bleſſing upon thy labours therein.</hi> Creatures may be the object of thy diligence, but God alone the object of thy <hi>confidence.</hi> Thy ſupplication muſt be to God, and thy expectation from God. Thou canſt as ſoon by thine own power add a cubit to thy ſtature, as a penny to thy purſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,</hi> Deut. 8.18. All thy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours without Gods bleſſing are but (as <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſaid of <hi>Senecas</hi> works) <hi>arena ſine calce,</hi> Sand without Lime, they will not hang together; if God bleſs them they proſper, if he blaſt them they periſh. The Devil himſelf was ſo far Orthodox, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the land.</hi> Alas the whole courſe of nature turneth onely as it is moved by the hand of God. It is not in the frame of nature as in frames of Art; when a watch is made, it may go though the workman be many miles off, or though he be dead; but there is not the leaſt wheel in the frame of nature which doth not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for its motion every moment. As the vapours exhaled by the Sun, depend ſo much upon
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:172730:268"/>it, that if that withdraw its influence, they fall to the earth; ſo do the Creatures depend on God; if he withdraw his influence from them, they preſently come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Take notice, Reader (to inſtance but in one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) how the genealogie of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> by a Concatenation of cauſes, is reſolved into <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah: I will hear the Heavens, and the Heavens ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and they ſhall hear Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 2.21, 22.

Hence ſome call the Earth <hi>Gods great Purſe,</hi> which he openeth for mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and ſhutteth for mans puniſhment. The Jewiſh Rabbies call the Earth <hi>Alma Parens, A kinde Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and the rain her <hi>Husband,</hi> becauſe the ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do foecundate and make that great Mother of plenty fruitful: But as likely a Mother as the Earth is to bring forth, ſhe is barren unleſs God open her womb: 1. The <hi>plowing and ſowing of the ground</hi> is from God; the hands of men cannot do it, without his protection and providence; and the heads of men would not have thought of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his direction and aſſiſtance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.24, 25, 26. to the end. 2. When the ground is plowed and ſowed, it muſt be <hi>watered,</hi> or the grain will quite dye; this alſo is from God alone.

God alone can unſtop thoſe bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Heaven; they are all above mans reach:
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:172730:269"/>The moſt ſpungy clouds diſtil not one drop, no more then a rock, till God give the Word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: He <hi>decreeth</hi> rain, <hi>Job</hi> 28.26. He <hi>prepareth</hi> rain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.7. and he <hi>poureth down</hi> the former and latter rain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.21. <hi>Job.</hi> 5.10.

The fruitfulneſs of the earth after it is ploughed, ſowed, watered with the clouds, and warmed with the influence of the Sun and Stars, is wholly from God: <hi>Thou crowneſt the year with thy goodneſs, and thy pathes drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

How eaſily can God blaſt all the corn in the field, or blow upon it in the barn! if he do but will it, it is done. The whole Creation indeed is but a glaſs without a bottom, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand of it ſelf, but as God is pleaſed to hold it up. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> tell us, the <hi>Sun</hi> and man beget a man; the <hi>Sun</hi> and the earth bring forth corn; and ſpeak of the <hi>Sun</hi> in every thing as a
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:172730:269"/>principal efficient; But the <hi>Divines</hi> tell us more truly, <hi>God</hi> and the Heavens, <hi>God</hi> and the Earth cauſe harveſt; God by the Creatures doth all things, God is the onely principal efficient; the Sun it ſelf, and all other Creatures, are but live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inſtruments, moved and acted by God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpoſe and pleaſure: <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it: It is in vain for you to riſe up early, to ſit up late, and to eat the bread of ſorrows;</hi> Pſal. 127.1, 2. Apricock trees that depend upon their own ſtrength, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on nothing (as experience teacheth us) bring forth little or no fruit, when they that lean on the wall abound in cluſters: The way to thrive in thy trade, is not to truſt to thy own head or hands, but to truſt in the Lord for a bleſſing on thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>If thou doſt proſper in thy Calling, let God alone have the praiſe:</hi> Do not <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to thy own <hi>net,</hi> Hab. 1.10. (as the Jews did) as though by thy skill and wiſdom thou hadſt met with ſuch a draught; but conſider, the providence of God hath brought in all thy profit: <hi>Beware when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy ſilver and thy gold is multiplied, leſt thine heart be lifted up; and thou ſay in thine heart, My power, and the might of my hands hath gotten me this wealth,</hi> Deut. 8.14. to 18.

               <p>The very Heathen were ſomewhat ſenſible of this:
<note place="margin">Strabo Geog.</note> The <hi>Metapontines</hi> after a plentiful Harveſt, which had much enriched them, dedicated an <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt cut in gold,</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> their God. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem; praiſe thy God, O Zion: For he maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fineſt of the wheat,</hi> Pſal. 147.12, 13, 14.

               <p>Some men are like Fiſhermens weels, wide to receive in mercies, but there is no paſſage out for the returning of praiſes.

So do thou Reader; when God bleſſeth the work of thy hands, ponder his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that thou mayeſt give him his praiſe, and think of thy own unworthineſs; thereby thou mayſt be preſerved from pride.

If thine eſtate <hi>decreaſe,</hi> let not thine heart <hi>deſpair;</hi> if the World <hi>flow in,</hi> let not thine heart <hi>flow out:</hi> O it was an excellent Leſſon which <hi>Paul</hi> had learned, <hi>I know in what ſtate ſoever I am to be content; I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound; I know how to be full, and how to be empty,</hi> Phil. 4.11. <hi>Paul</hi> was not like a muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument out of tune with every change of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but like the Cypreſs tree, which no ſtorms (Naturaliſts tell us) can alter; and like the Hill <hi>Olympus,</hi> above all winds and weather.</p>
               <p>Some men are like the leaves of a tree, which every wind ſets a ſhaking and trembling; or like a bone out of joynt, which a man cannot ſtir with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain; if the World do but frown upon them, you may ſee it in their faces, they are quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with ſorrow: O how heavy preſently are their hearts, as if they had loſt their Heaven! It is to be feared that bough is rotten, which break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if but a little weight be hung upon it. A godly man ſhould be like a Rock, immoveable, though high winds, and boiſterous waves of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence blow and beat upon him; and like a Die, however he be thrown, always to fall upon a ſquare. The Traveller need not murmure, though his Inn afford him but mean fare, and an hard bed, when he knoweth that he muſt be gone
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:172730:271"/>next morning. The Ox is not happier which hath two or three mountains to graze on, then the Bee which feedeth upon that dew which falleth daily from the ſtore-houſe of Heaven: If thou haſt ſecur'd thine ever laſting eſtate, the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God is thy portion, and ſurely then thou mayſt be like a ſpring full, under the moſt ſcorching Providence.</p>
               <p>It was a worthy ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr (to one who asked him whether he ſhould petition the Queen for his life) <hi>If the Queen will take away my life, I will thank her; if ſhe will give me my life, I will thank her; if ſhe will baniſh me, I will thank her; if ſhe will burn me, I will thank her; let her deal with me how ſhe pleaſeth, I will thank her.</hi> So Reader, thy heart will be in an excellent frame indeed, if thou canſt thank God when he enricheth thee, and thank him when he impoveriſheth thee; if thou canſt thank him when he ſmiles on thee with the light of his countenance, and thank him alſo if he frown by ſome ſad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; if thou canſt thank him when he is at Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and thank him when he is at Subſtraction; thank him <hi>giving</hi> to thee, and thank him taking from thee: O here is an heart worth gold indeed; Truly the want of this calmneſs and compoſedneſs of minde, is a great impediment to Chriſtians. Alas, when their ſpirits are like ſome mens fleſh, no ſooner razed with a pin, but they rankle and feſter; no ſooner touched with a light affliction, but they faint, and are dejected; how unfit are they for Religious actions! as men in extremity of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:172730:272"/>pain, they rather chatter, then <hi>pour out a prayer.</hi> Either men muſt uſe the World, as if they uſed it not; or they will ſerve the Lord, as if they ſerved him not: He who knoweth that nothing can befal him whileſt he is diligent in his calling, but what is the fruit of bottomleſs love, and the reſult of infinite wiſdom, may certainly be ſteady in the greateſt ſtorm: Thrice happy is that ſoul who hath ſo much care of doing his work, and ſuch an eye to the recompence of reward, that the allurements and affrightments of the World (though they may aſſault the outworks) can never ſurprize the Royal Fort of his heart.</p>
               <p>The onely way, Reader, to finde thine own will, is, to loſe it in Gods will: Thoſe that grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his doings, and quarrel at his dealings, do but like a Bull in the net, and the ſilly Bird among the lime-twigs, by ſtrugling intangle themſelves the more. Unſubmiſſiveneſs to Gods <hi>will,</hi> is the fountain of all mans wo; the quiet reſignation of our perſons and portions to Gods pleaſure, is the onely <hi>ſleeping pill</hi> which can give reſt to the ſoul. Chriſtian, let me ask thee this queſtion, Didſt thou give up thy ſelf to Chriſt for Temporal, or for Eternal comforts? Didſt thou enter upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſave thine Eſtate, or thy Soul? O why then ſhouldſt thou be ſo ſad, when thy Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo ſafe! For ſhame live like a childe of God, an heir of Heaven; and let the World know, that thy hopes and happineſs are in a better World; that though thou art denyed thoſe Acorns which thy Father giveth to his Hogs, yet thou
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:172730:272"/>haſt the Childrens bread and expecteſt thine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance when thou comeſt to Age.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A Family is a natural and ſimple Society of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, having mutual relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the private government of one head, or chief. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth Families the firſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in nature, and the ground of all the reſt. Before the Flood, the whole form of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Government, was confined within the Precincts of private Families. A Family is the Epitome of a Kingdom and Commonwealth in a little volume. The way to make godly Pariſhes, and godly Countreys, and godly Kingdoms, is to make godly Families. When ſin as a plague ſpeadeth abroad, it beginneth in Families: One Atheiſtical Family, defileth and deſtroyeth many; it ſendeth a ſon into one houſe, a daughter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, a ſervant into a third, and every of them, like infectious perſons, poyſon thoſe with whom they converſe: Like a neſt of Foxes, they deſtroy and devour all the Countrey over. As
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:172730:284"/>one Houſe on fire, often burneth down many, ſo one prophane Family injureth many; one godly Family on the contrary, doth good to many: As one ſtock of Bees ſendeth forth ſwarms and honey, into many parts of the Countrey; ſo one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Familie ſending Religious Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants abroad (they come in time to have Families of their own) may bring much honor to God, and be helpful to the eternal welfare of many ſouls.</p>
               <p>A Godleſs Family, like a Gun or Cannon, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at a diſtance, as their ſwearing children, and drunken ſervants come to ſpread abroad. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Family, like the Weapon-ſalve, healeth at a diſtance, as the pious Relations in it, come to be diſperſed in other places. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſe-keeper, and it is obſervable his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were ſo ſeaſoned by him with godlineſs, that their children five hundred years after, were recorded by the Spirit of God, to be the moſt eminent in their time for Religion, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.58. <hi>Solomon</hi> being a godly Governor of his Family, did good after he was dead, at ſo great a diſtance. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being asked, how a private perſon might be a publique good: anſwered, <hi>By ordering all things well at home.</hi> The way to make our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards good, is to look well to our Nurſeries.</p>
               <p>It concerneth thee therefore, Reader, nearly, to exalt godlineſs in thy houſe, as well as in thy heart; nay, I will be bold to tell thee, if there be in thee the truth of Religion, thou wilt propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it amongſt thy Relations: Thou wilt not be
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:172730:285"/>like the Whirpool, to ſuck all into thy ſelf, but be diffuſive for the good of others. A good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is like a needle touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which being drawn it ſelf, will draw others along with it. When Chriſt had drawn <hi>Philip,</hi> he preſently draweth <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 43.45. The Bird hath no ſooner found an heap of corn, but ſhe chirpeth and calleth her fellows, and will be ſure to carry ſome home to her neſt. A Saint ſhould endeavour the converſion of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that they may eat of the bread of life with him; but he ſhould have a ſpecial regard to his own family, that all in it may feed on Chriſt by faith, and live. Nature hath taught the Bevers to help one another in ſwiming; and the Cranes flying over the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> when the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is weary in beating the ayr, that the next ſhould ſucceed, and ſo in order every one to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the ſafety of them all. Chriſtians are taught from other creatures, to be helpful one to another; but the Maſter of the family, like the Sun, muſt outſhine all in reſpect of publique influence.</p>

<pb n="519" facs="tcp:172730:285"/>that it was <hi>Schola vel Palaeſtra Pietatis &amp; Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; The School or Nurſery of Piety and Learning.</hi> The houſes of the primitive Chriſtians were little <hi>Churches,</hi> in regard of the Worſhip and Service of God: <hi>To the Church that is in thine houſe,</hi> Philem. v. 2. Rom. 16.5. 1 Cor. 16.9. Coloſ. 4.15. Though many a mans houſe is ſo far from being Gods Church and Temple, that its the Devils ſtye and kennel, that God may ſay to the Maſter of the Family, as in Rev. 2.13. <hi>I know where thou dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>left, even where Satans Throne is:</hi> Nay, though they are civil abroad, then they will have ſome rags to cover their naughtineſs, they are ſordid at home, and diſcover there all their nakedneſs and naſtineſs. <hi>David</hi> on the contrary, whatever ſteps he might take awry, and whatſoever ſlips he might meet with in his publique walking, would be ſure to look to his feet in his private dwelling: <hi>I will walk in the midſt of my houſe with a perfect heart, until thou come unto me,</hi> Pſal. 101.2. <hi>David</hi> was no Hypocrite, he did not put on his beſt cloathes when he went out, and put them off when he came in; but Purity was his livery, as abroad, ſo at home.</p>
               <p>Imitate that pious Governor (who though he had the burthen of all the Iſraelites, Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs lying upon his ſhoulders, yet could ſay, <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, I ſhall offer two thoughts to quicken thee to this neceſſary duty, and then give thee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the management of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that <hi>Religion in a Family is the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:172730:286"/>way to procure Gods bleſſing on thy Family. The holy family alone is the happy family. The Lord bleſſed the houſe of Obed-Edom for the Arks ſake,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.11. If the <hi>Ark</hi> be in the houſe; that is, Religion, God is there, for the <hi>Ark</hi> was a type of Gods preſence; and canſt thou need any comforts when thou haſt Gods Company?</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher could ſay, Though he had few goods in his houſe, yet he had the Gods in his houſe. Though thou haſt a poor dwelling, yet if Godlineſs be there, thou ſhalt have Gods bleſſing. <hi>His preſence will make the habitation of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proſperous,</hi> Job 8.6. Thou mayſt ſay of thy houſe as <hi>Jacob</hi> of <hi>Bethel, The Lord is in this place, this is none other but the Houſe of God. Baſil</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in ſome Countries they draw other Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Dove-houſes by anointing one of their Pigeons wings with ſweet Ointment. If thy houſe be anointed with the Oyl of godlineſs, it will allure the bleſſed God to it, and then what evil needſt thou fear, or what good canſt thou want? It is obſerved of the <hi>Palladium</hi> in <hi>Troy,</hi> that whilſt that remained amongſt them, their City was ſafe. The onely way to have a deſtroying Angel paſs by thy houſe, is to have the door-poſts ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Through wiſdom is an houſe builded, and by underſtanding it is eſtabliſhed; And by knowledge ſhall the chambers be filled with all pleaſant and precious riches,</hi> Pro. 24.3, 4. <hi>Here is true wealth, and the right way to injoy it.</hi> 1. The <hi>true wealth, thy chambers ſhall be filled with all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and precious riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="521" facs="tcp:172730:286"/>
               <p>Righteouſneſs is the beſt way to riches. 2. <hi>The way to this,</hi> by wiſdom an houſe is builded, and it is eſtabliſhed by underſtanding. By wiſdom and underſtanding, Godlineſs is underſtood; <hi>And unto man he ſaid, Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding,</hi> Job 28. <hi>ult.</hi> This wiſdom is the beſt foundation for any houſe to ſtand upon. When Religion layeth the foundation, raiſeth the walls, and covereth the roof, ſuch a houſe is built upon a Rock, and will ſtand againſt all the Winds and Waves, wrath and rage of men and devils. <hi>Some Families had laſted longer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther, if they had been holier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Religion will bring a bleſſing on thy eſtate, <hi>Job</hi> 1.10. Bleſſed is he that feareth the Lord, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth greatly in his Commandements; For thou ſhalt eat the labour of thy hands; happy ſhalt thou be, and it ſhall be well with thee, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 128.1, 2. It will bring a bleſſing on thy Children. God will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.7. The branches will fare the better for the ſap of grace which is in the root. It will bring a bleſſing on thy name, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.7. Holineſs will make thy houſe truely honorable; It will bring a bleſſing on all thine affairs. In a word, that day in which Religion is ſet up in thy houſe, I may ſay to thee as Chriſt to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> This day Salvation is come to thy houſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, A Family without Religion is a curſed family. That houſe which is not <hi>Bethel,</hi> an Houſe of God, but <hi>Bethaven,</hi> an houſe of vanity, is <hi>Bethany</hi> an houſe of ſorrow and miſery. <hi>The curſe
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:172730:287"/>of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked,</hi> Pro. 3.33. Whatſoever Cordials or comfors, diſhes or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are there, <hi>the curſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As a little Leven, a little of this curſe of God will ſowre the whole lump of thy family-bleſſings. <hi>I have ſeen the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh taking root, but ſuddenly I curſed his habitation,</hi> Job 5.3. The words are not a malediction from <hi>Eliphaz</hi> private ſpirit, but a prediction from Gods ſpirit, as if he had ſaid <hi>I was neither malicious againſt his perſon, nor envious at his proſperous condition, but by the help of the Holy Ghoſt, I foreſaw his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that though his houſe was built high, yet his unholineſs would lay it low.</hi> Thou mayſt poſſibly preſume that though thou liveſt without God, yet thou art beyond the reach of his rod; thou canſt mote thy houſe round againſt the fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fury, <hi>but thy confidence ſhall be rooted out of thy tabernacle, and brimſtone ſhall be ſcattered on thy habitation.</hi> God will unkennel all ſuch foxes, and drag them to their deſerved deſtruction.

               <p>Atheiſm in thy houſe will bring a <hi>curſe</hi> upon thy <hi>calling,</hi> Job 5.2, 3. The works of thy hands will fare the worſe for the wickedneſs of thy heart: On thy <hi>children</hi> (its ill to be related to a Traytor) diſeaſes, and ſo deſtruction may be hereditary. Children may inherit both their Parents riches and ruine, <hi>Job</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.20. His ſeed are far from ſafety, they are cruſhed. When a wicked man pulls down his houſe upon his head, many in it periſh with him; as when <hi>Sampſon</hi> pulled the houſe down upon the Philiſtines.</p>
               <p>The curſe of God will be a moth in thy Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, murrain among thy cattel, mildew in the field, the plague to thy body, wrath to thy ſoul, will indeed make thy houſe a very hell upon earth. The higheſt Family in the World without god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, though never ſo rich and ruffling, is but like <hi>Golgatha,</hi> a place full of frightful skulls; and like a Church-yard, full of carkaſſes, gilded, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and golden Damnation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now lay down ſome Directions how thou may exerciſe thy ſelf to godlineſs, as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a Family.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Be careful whom thou admitteſt into thy Family:</hi> Art thou unmarried, and to chuſe an Husband or Wife? Do thy occaſions call for a man-ſervant, or a maid-ſervant? Be careful where thou fixeſt; for believe it, not onely thy grace will appear in a good choice, but alſo godlineſs will be much hindred or furthered by thy choice: <hi>One ſinner deſtroyeth much good,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.18. One
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:172730:288"/>man may pull down that houſe, which many with much care, coſt and pains did ſet up. We read, that wicked men have been the better, for taking godly men into their families, as <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar;</hi> but we never read that godly men were ever the better for having wicked perſons into their families; nay, how much have they been the worſe, and by ſuch been brought to great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs! As black corn, they ſmut and ſully the good corn; as ruſty armor, they injure that which is bright, by being near it.

And wilt thou, Friend, take them into thy houſe to dwell with thee, that will bring the plague along with them, and thereby probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the bodies and ſouls of others? Canſt thou think it ſafe, for a little Worldly advantage, to be nigh them who are under Gods fury, and next door to eternal fire?

               <p>It was the advice of the late Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in his Book of Precepts to his Son, <hi>That he ſhould be exceeding careful whom he matched with, becauſe as in a project of War, when an Army is foiled by the Enemy, they ſeldom recover; ſo to erre once in the choice of a Wife, is uſually to be undone for ever; and the more cauſe there is of ſpecial care, becauſe he that ſeeketh out for a wife, goeth to a Lottery, where he ſhall meet with ahundred blanks for one prize.</hi>

               <p>But I am perſwading thee to circumſpection in this particular, not upon a Politick, but a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious principle, as thou wouldſt exalt Religion
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:172730:289"/>in thy habitation. Next to thy ſelf, thy Wife will be the beſt friend, or worſt foe, that Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can have in thy Family. Nay, poſſibly, and probably too, if thy Wife ſhould be wicked, though thou art at preſent like a ſound Apple, thou mayſt quickly be ſpeckt, by lying neer one that is all over rotten: The nearer the relation, the eaſier and ſpeedier is the infection. He that could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Lyon to his glory, was himſelf overcome by a woman to his ſin and ſhame. The moſt perfect man, <hi>Adam;</hi> the ſtrongeſt man, <hi>Sampſon;</hi> the wiſeſt man, <hi>Solomon;</hi> were all betrayed by their Wives into the hands of their ſpiritual Enemies; the meekeſt man, <hi>Moſes,</hi> hearkened ſo much to his Wife, that it was like to have coſt him his life. Some Expoſitors give this reaſon why Satan ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife, when he ſlew his children, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him (ſurely the Devil did not love <hi>Job</hi> ſo well) but to croſs him, by provoking him to curſe God: The Devil knew that none was ſo fit to preſent that poyſonous potion with ſucceſs to <hi>Job,</hi> as his Wife; that if he ever took it, her fair hands muſt give it, and her ſugred words ſweeten it. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wo be to him that is alone;</hi> ſurely it is alſo true, <hi>Wo be to him who is not alone, but hath a wicked wife like a ſnake in his boſom.</hi>

               <p>Reader, Doſt thou want a Servant? chooſe for God, not for thy ſelf: Let not thy main quaere be, Whether he can do thy work; but, Whether he will ſubmit to Gods Word: Though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer muſt not be neglected, yet the latter muſt be preferred. It may be for advantage ſake, thou
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:172730:290"/>receiveſt a drunken or ſwearing perſon into thy houſe; but doſt thou conſider that he will be an <hi>Achan,</hi> a troubler of thy Family? Canſt thou think to do Gods work with the Devils tools? Put off thy diſguiſe of Chriſtianity, if thou eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy particular calling above thy general. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Doſt thou know what thou haſt done? thou haſt taken into thy houſe an Uſher to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thy children in the black Art of Hell: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, thy children will catch <hi>ſins</hi> as ſoon as <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> from thoſe that are of Satans ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Thy Sons and Daughters are like <hi>Polypus</hi> in <hi>Aelian,</hi> that turneth to the colour of that rock, or weed in the Sea, which lieth neareſt. Once more, thou wilt be fruſtrated in the end, of thy entertaining ſuch a ſervant; for they will never be <hi>faithful</hi> to their Maſter, who are <hi>unfaithful</hi> to their Maker. <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Father of famous <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> gave out, That all ſuch as would not deny the faith, ſhould be deprived of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and offices: Whereupon ſeveral forſook the Faith, others ſtuck cloſe to the Truth: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperor when he had diſcovered thoſe halting, hypocritical perſons, turned them all out of their places, ſaying, <hi>That they who were falſe to God, would never be faithful to man:</hi> I do a little queſtion his policy in the premiſes; but his piety in the concluſion is out of queſtion; for they who will rob God of his glory, will (if opportunity ſerve) rob men of their goods and good name too. It is recorded to the credit of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe would ſuffer no Lady to approach her

               <p>As thou wouldſt have Gods company in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, do not entertain his enemies into thy family. <hi>What communion hath God with Belial.</hi> As thou wouldſt make Religion thy buſineſs, avoid thoſe quench-coals, thoſe hinderers of holineſs, <hi>Bid the workers of iniquity depart, if thou wouldſt keep the commandments of thy God,</hi> Pſalm. 119.115.</p>

               <p>It was propheſied that in the days of the Goſpel, the ſpirit ſhould be poured down upon men, and they ſhould ſee Chriſt, and mourn <hi>every family apart, Zac.</hi> 2.10. It was the advice of <hi>Hierom</hi> to a pious Matron; So take care of thine houſe as alway to allow liberty and time to thy ſoul; the Governour hath the cure of the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:172730:291"/>ſouls, as well as of the bodies in his familie; and if he mind their outward man and neglecteth their inward, he is but a brute in humane ſhape, for beaſts feed the bodies of their young.</p>
               <p>As the School fitteth young men for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; ſo holy performances in private, prepare ſervants and children for, and help them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Ordinances of God in publique. A foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation well laid by the Maſter of a Family, is a great help to the Miniſter, when he goeth to rear and raiſe the building: Confident I am, our work would not have half that difficulty which now it hath, if Maſters of Families would but do their duties; he that findeth his timber ready hewn to his hand, hath a great advantage in ſetting up an houſe, of him that muſt fell, bark, ſeaſon and hew it himſelf. It is no wonder that an Apprentice is ſo backward to his work, and ſo bungling at it when he is wholly unacquainted with it, and a ſtranger to it; If Children and Servants were accuſtomed to religious exerciſes at home, Sermons would not be ſo tedious, nor Sabbaths ſo tireſome to them as they are.</p>
               <p>The ordinary duties in Families are prayer, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, with inſtructing Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants out of it, and ſinging.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> that he had Family prayer four times a day. At ſix in the morning, &amp; eight at night, and before dinner and Supper in his Chappel, <hi>David returned to bleſs his houſe,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.21. that is, ſay Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to bleſs God with his Family, and to beg
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:172730:291"/>Gods bleſſing on his family. <hi>He ſter</hi> prayed and faſted with her Maidens, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.16. The holy Ghoſt enjoyneth Husband and wife, <hi>to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as fellow-heirs of the grace of life, that their prayers be not hindered,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. Our bleſſed Saviour is to be our pattern, now he prayed with his family of Diſciples; <hi>And it came to paſs as he was alone praying, his Diſciples were with him,</hi> Luk. 9.18. He was alone, not <hi>ſecretly,</hi> to exclude all ſociety, but privately, to include onely his own family. Our Houſes are Gods Houſes, and in Gods Houſe there muſt every day be morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice; <hi>I will that men pray every where,</hi> ſurely then in private as well as in ſecret, and in publique, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Families need direction in the day, and protection in the night, and truely either of them is worth a prayer. Thy family ſins muſt be pardoned, thy family wants muſt be ſupplied, and if they do not deſerve a prayer they deſerve nothing. Horſes kneel before they lye down at night, and when they riſe up in the morning; and ſhall thy houſe be worſe then a ſtable of beaſts!</p>
               <p>They that will not beg family ſupplies, and bleſſe God for family mercies, may well be branded for ungodly and ungrateful wrethces. Prayer and prayſe are like the double motion of the lungs; what we ſuck in by petition, we breath out in thankſgiving, and without this, Religion cannot live in a family. What dangers are thy family liable to every day, and without prayer thou haſt no guide, no guard? <hi>Origen</hi> going once to comfort a Martyr was himſelf apprehended and conſtrained
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:172730:292"/>either to have his body abuſed by a Blackamore, or to offer to the Idol; which latter he did, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing it ſaith, <hi>I went out that morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer, which I know was the cauſe of that evil.</hi>

               <p>Its ſaid of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that there was a great cry at midnight, <hi>for in every houſe there was one dead.</hi> Reader, are there not dead ſouls in thy family, Children and ſervants dead in ſins, and treſpaſſes, and ſhall there be no cry, no complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God there! I muſt tell thee thy houſe is worſe then a Peſt-houſe, for thou haſt infected, and dangerouſly diſeaſed ſouls in it, and not ſo much as Lord have mercy upon us, written on thy door. <hi>Heathens,</hi> and families without prayer, are fitly joyned together, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> The truth is, ſuch perſons are Engliſh in their language, but Indian in their Athieſtical carriage. They feed and cloath their bodies like Engliſh men, but they ſtarve and go naked in their ſouls, like <hi>Indians.</hi> Onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ, that they cannot be prayerleſs in their Houſes at ſo cheap a rate, but muſt expect an hotter Hell, becauſe they ſin againſt a clearer light. Many families are the picture of Hell, one may hear twenty Oaths for one prayer; the Maſter will often curſe but ſeldom or never bleſs his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; he loveth curſing, ſo it will come to him, and as he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo it will be far from him.</p>
               <p>Do not ſay, thou canſt not pray. Had the father of ſpirits ever any dumb children. Every begger at thy door who is pinched with hunger, will

               <p>Thy affections in prayer, if right, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly make up thy want of expreſſions: A ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Heart, is better then a ſilver Tongue. Though thou haſt not the gift of prayer, yet if if thou canſt act grace in prayer, all will be well.</p>
               <p>Pray much in ſecret, and thou wilt quickly learn to pray well in private: Uſe at any Trade, will make me prompt and perfect.</p>
               <p>Rather uſe a form out of a Book, then omit the duty.

Obſerve, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, a good man,</hi> denyeth his Wife; <hi>Iſaac</hi> is his heir not onely in his wealth, but alſo in that weakneſs; <hi>Iſaac</hi> denieth his Wife likewiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.2. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 26 7. <hi>Jacobs</hi> wives got little good by the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and practice of <hi>Laban</hi> their father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.19. <hi>and</hi> 35.1, 2.</p>
               <p>The Parents of the Children deſtroyed by the two ſhe-Bears, were wont to jeer <hi>Elijah</hi> in their ordinary talk; <hi>What</hi> Elijah <hi>the bald-pate muſt be taken up to Heaven, Forſooth, as well as</hi> Elias.

O Reader, doth not thine heart ake to read this, and haſt thou not abundant cauſe to be heedful, leſt by thy pattern thou ſhouldſt draw thy Children to ſin, and to Hell!

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerveth of <hi>Cato</hi> that he was very wary not to ſpeak an uncomely word in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Children.
<note place="margin">Plut. in vit Cat.</note> This Heathen will condemn many Chriſtians, who will curſe, and ſwear, and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:172730:297"/>drink and roar, and that in preſence of their children; Reader, avoid ſin, both for thy own and others ſake. As a ſtone thrown into the water, makes but one circle at firſt, but that one begetteth many; ſo though the ſin in thee at firſt be but one, ye it may cauſe many both in thy children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The ſin of a Maſter or Miſtris is like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Air, which others breathing in are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it. Thy ſervants will as readily put on thy luſts as thy livery, and thy Children will be proud of ſuch a patronage, ſuch a cloak for their villany. A dark eye benights the whole body. Weigh all thy words and all thy works, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how many followers thou haſt, he that ſinneth once, ſinneth twice if he ſin before others.</p>
               <p>Be ſerious and diligent about the concernments of God and thy ſoul, that others may take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by thee. The biggeſt Stars are brighteſt and give light to thoſe that are of a leſſer magnitude; Thou who art the greateſt, ſhouldſt be the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the family; if the Sun ſhine not on the mountains, it muſt needs be ſet in the vallies. If thy children and ſervants behold thee careful of thy language, and conſciencious in thy carriage, when they ſee thee humble, fervent, conſtant and ſerious in holy duties, they may learn by thee and write after thee; ſuch a patten may tend exceedingly to thy ſpiritual profit.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by <hi>Cicero,</hi> that he would never ſay to his Souldiers <hi>Ite ſed Venite, Go ye,</hi> but, <hi>Come ye,</hi> marching before them himſelf, and giving them a pattern. Do thou Reader, go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Naturaliſts tell us of the Mulberry tree, that there is nothing in it but what is Medicinal in ſome ſort or other; the <hi>fruit,</hi> the <hi>root,</hi> the <hi>bark,</hi> the <hi>leaf,</hi> all are uſeful. Truly, ſo it ought to be with thee: All thy expreſſions, all thy actions ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to thy Inferiours. Thy behaviour in private, in publique towards God, towards thy Wife, towards thy Children, towards thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, towards thy Neighbours, ſhould all be Lectures to teach others Religion and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that you may be able to ſay to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as <hi>Seneca</hi> to his Siſter, <hi>Though I can leave you no great portion, yet I leave you a good pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, one work required of thee (as I ſhall ſhew thee before the concluſion of this Chapter) is, to admoniſh and reprove others in thy family for their faults; which with what face canſt thou do, or with what hope of ſucceſs, unleſs thou art free thy ſelf? It was a ſhame to <hi>Plutarch</hi> that his Servant ſhould ſay, <hi>My Maſter writeth falſly; he ſaith it is unbeſeeming a Philoſopher to be angry,</hi> &amp; ipſe mihi iraſcitur, <hi>and he himſelf is angry with me.</hi> If thou reproveſt thy childe for not praying, and thy ſervant for drunkenneſs, and art guilty thy ſelf, though thou acquainteſt them never ſo much with the wrath of God, which will certainly ſeize upon Atheiſts and Drunkards, they will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee; for they know thou doſt not believe thy
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:172730:298"/>ſelf. Thy words would ſeem to draw the nail of ſin out, but thy works are ſuch an heavy hammer, that they drive it in to the very head. When the rude Souldiers ſaw the Roman Senators ſit gravely, and diſcourſe ſoberly, they took them for gods, and were awful of them; but when they perceived one of them to grow waſpiſh, they took them for men, and ſpoiled them. <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>Johns</hi> reproof, <hi>knowing that he was a juſt man,</hi> Mark 6.20. Where there is piety in the perſon, there is majeſtie and authority in the reprehenſion. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. The Snuffers of the Sanctuary were of <hi>pure gold:</hi> He that would reprove others <hi>dimneſs,</hi> and make them ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the light of holineſs, had need to be <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, walk unſpottedly; otherwiſe when thou threateneſt thy children or ſervants with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt fin, thou doſt, like <hi>David,</hi> paſs a ſentence of death and condemnation againſt thy own ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be careful and diligent that thy whole Family may ſanctifie the Lords Day:</hi> When the Iſraelites were to ſacrifice to God in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they went with ther little ones, and all their houſholds, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. When <hi>Elkanah</hi> went up to ſacrifice to the Lord, <hi>all his houſe went with him,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.21. Thy duty is, according to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to ſee that all thy family (unleſs neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould hinder) ſerve the Lord in publique. Do not ſuffer any of thine to be playing idly in the Churchyard, when they ſhould be praying earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:172730:298"/>in the Church; nor to be talking vainly of the World, when they ſhould be hearkning reverently to the Word. O what pity is it, that they ſhould be ſucking poyſon, when they ſhould be ſucking milk out of the breaſts of Conſolation! The fourth Commandment doth fully ſpeak thy duty, not onely to be careful that they forbear thy <hi>work,</hi> but alſo that they minde Gods <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Thou knoweſt not, but that thy childe or ſervant, by miſſing one <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> may miſs of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Poſſibly they are wrought hard in the Week days, and have very little time for their ſouls, ſo that their onely time of improving their ſpiritual ſtock, by trading towards Heaven, is on a Sabbath Day. Or it may be they are careleſs of their main work (of providing for the other World) all the Week, that if thou ſhouldſt neglect them on the Lords Day, they will he left under a neceſſity of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Surely they who have but one good meal in ſeven days, and are robbed of that, are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveably wronged. When <hi>David</hi> came to his Brethren to the Camp, <hi>Eliab</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>How cameſt thou down hither? Where is the flock? and with whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs?</hi> (1 Sam. 17.28.) <hi>I know the pride, and the haughtineſs of thy heart.</hi> Give not God cauſe to greet thee thus at Church, <hi>How cameſt thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Where is thy flock, thy Family? With whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep, thy Children, and thy Servants? I know thy pride, they are not good enough to come along with thee, or to be minded by thee:</hi> or, <hi>I know thy covetouſneſs, thou haſt imployed them
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:172730:299"/>about earthly buſineſſes:</hi> or, <hi>I know thy careleſneſs and Soul-cruelty, thou careſt not what becometh of them, whether they be ſaved or damned for ever.</hi> I tell thee Friend, ſome Gentlemen by going abroad alone without their ſervants, have loſt their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and for ought I know, by thy going to Church without thy company, thou mayeſt loſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and efficacy of the Ordinances. How canſt thou expect that God ſhould have any care of thy ſoul, when thou trampleſt the precious ſouls of others under thy feet, which he hath given thee ſpecial charge of?</p>
               <p>O Reader, think of it; Are not thy children and Servants ſtrangers to God, <hi>and alienated from his life, through the ignorance that is in them?</hi> And is not the Miniſtery of the Word appointed to turn men <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God?</hi> How ſhall they be converted, if the Ordinances of God be neglected? Though a perſon be dangerouſly diſeaſed, if he obſerve his purging days, according to the advice of his able Phyſician, there may be hopes of recovery; but if he neglect the means, if he periſh, it will be no marvel: If thy children and Servants are holy, canſt thou expect the fire of Grace ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or encreaſe, whilſt thou takeſt away the fuel? Doſt thou think that Spiritual Life can be maintained without Spiritual Meat?</p>
               <p>In private alſo be watchful over thy Family, that all under thy charge be preſent at holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Singing, Praying, repetition of Sermons,</hi> and the like: Thou art careful that in the Week days
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:172730:299"/>they do work diligently; and why ſhouldſt thou not be as careful that they do Gods work on his day? Is thy work of greater concernment then Gods? or doſt thou love thy ſelf, the poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering World I mean, above the bleſſed God?</p>
               <p>Examine thoſe who waited on the Word of God in publique, what good they have got, what leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they have learned from the great Maſter of Aſſemblies? Our Saviour after Sermon, asked thoſe of his Family, <hi>Have ye underſtood all theſe Sayings?</hi> Mat. 13.5. Hereby thou wilt make them more attentive in publique Ordinances, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their memories; as alſo, by this means, thou mayeſt quicken thy own affections.</p>
               <p>Suffer none of thy houſe to ſpend any part of the day either in idleneſs, paſtimes, or worldly buſineſs. Thou art accountable to God as well for ſins of permiſſion, as for ſins of commiſſion; and it will another day be imputed to thy charge, if the day be prophaned by thy careleſneſs: If thou wouldſt not ſuffer for others, do not ſuffer others in ſin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Let Diſcipline be ſet up in thy Family:</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> would dedicate his houſe to God, he commandeth all his Family to change their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and put away their ſtrange gods: Their change of garments, did ſignifie that change of heart and life which he deſired ſhould be his houſholds livery, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.1, 2. As the Governor of a Family muſt be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to pray, and a <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach, ſo alſo a <hi>King</hi> to rule; to be a terror to evil doers, and an encouragement to them that do
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:172730:300"/>well in his family: <hi>Let not wickedneſs dwell in thy Tabernacle,</hi> Job 11.14. <hi>Zophar</hi> meaneth not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or perſonal (though ſo the word is ſometimes taken, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.) but a domeſtical and civil Tabernacle. Though ſin may come into thy houſe by children or ſervants commiſſion, yet it muſt not dwell there, but be caſt out by ſevere reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Wickedneſs is a bold gueſt, it will come uncalled; but it muſt be more bold then welcome; it muſt <hi>not dwell in thy Tabernacle.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Cato,</hi> he would bear with faults any where rather then at home. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> at night called his ſervants to an account how they had ſpent the day, and after prayer, admoniſhed them accordingly.</p>
               <p>Thy duty is to <hi>warn the unruly,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.13. to acquaint them of ſin (how near and dear ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to thee) with the diſhonor they bring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to God, the diſgrace to the Goſpel, and the diſadvantage and deſtruction to their own ſouls. If the fault be the firſt, or of infirmity, or not ſo great a ſin as to waſte the conſcience, and poyſon thy family by its pattern, let the medicine thou applieſt for its cure be milde: Earthen glaſſes muſt be tenderly waſhed, when iron veſſels muſt be ſcoured with wiſps: <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference,</hi> Jude v. 22. Who would that is wiſe, give the ſame phyſick to an infant, which would purge a luſty grown perſon? Iſa. 28.27, 28. <hi>For the fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither is a cart-wheel turned about with the Cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a ſtaff, and the Cummin with a rod.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:172730:300"/>
               <p>If the crime be crimſom, and ſcandalous, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, or juſtified, <hi>rebuke ſharply;</hi> hard knots muſt have ſtrong and ſharp wedges: <hi>Others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire,</hi> Jude v. 23. In ſuch a caſe, weak phyſick will onely ſtir, not remove the diſeaſe, and thereby leave the Patient in a worſe condition then it found him. Nettles touched gently, ſting the more: A prick with a rapier is more dangerous ſometimes then a wound with a ſword, becauſe the latter wideneth the orifice, and thereby maketh the place more open to the plaiſter which ſhould heal it. It is much better for them to be preſerved in brine and pickle, then to rot in fleſh-pleaſing and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Kindeneſs, and bearing with ſuch in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, is like the kiſs of <hi>Judas</hi> to Chriſt, a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and like <hi>Joabs</hi> ſalutation to <hi>Abner,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying and killing them.</p>
               <p>Be ſure therefore not to bear with any under thy charge in ſin: <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> He is a drone unſerviceable to his houſe, his hive, who hath loſt this ſting of reproof. Pious <hi>Aſa</hi> would not ſuffer ſin in his own Mother: <hi>Aſa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his mother Maachah from being Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe made an Idol in a grove; and Aſa cut down her Idol, and ſtamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.16. Patient <hi>Job</hi> would not ſuffer ſin in his own Wife; <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like a fooliſh woman,</hi> Job 2.6. Plain-hearted <hi>Jacob</hi> would not ſuffer ſin his his own Children, <hi>Ye have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, to make me to ſtink among the inhabitants
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:172730:301"/>of the Land: Curſed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel,</hi> Gen. 34.30. and 49.7. <hi>David</hi> would not abide ſin in a Servant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.7. nor <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in his own Siſter.</p>
               <p>Let thy reproofs againſt ſin be mingled with, and ſo managed, that they may manifeſt love to to their ſouls. When the nail is dipt in greaſe, it entreth without renting the board: When repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is dipt in, and tipt with love, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enter the heart without cutting it in pieces with rage and revenge. Prudence may do much towards the advancement of the offendors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in this particular.</p>
               <p>Though thy words ſhould be ſoft, yet thine Arguments ſhould be hard againſt the ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: To this end, let thy reproofs be as near as may be in Scripture phraſes, that the offendor may ſee it is not ſo much man as God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh him for his fault. The Word is a <hi>hammer,</hi> if well laid on, it will drive the nail of reproof to the head. If the oyl of reprehenſion be gently and prudently bathed in by the hot fire of the Word, it may abate very great ſwellings. But be ſure to perform this duty: The Magiſtrate who ſpareth a man ſlayer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spencer,</hi> 182.576.</note> is guilty of his ſecond murther: <hi>Plato</hi> ſeeing a childe commit a fault, went and corrected his Father. The Maſter of a family who alloweth any in ſin, is partaker of their ſin: We perpetrate thoſe ſins which we may, and do not prevent; we ſhall anſwer one day for ſins of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> as well as for ſins of <hi>commiſſion.</hi> O how
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:172730:301"/>miſerable will thy condition be, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations in thy Family (which thou knoweſt of, and winkeſt at) ſhall all be charged upon thee! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts tell us, that if a Serpent eat a Serpent, it becomes a Dragon: If thou to thy own ſins, adde the ſins of thy children and ſervants, what a Monſter in ſin wilt thou be? Are not thy own ſins heavy enough? doſt thou want more load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy precious ſoul to ſink thee deeper into Hell! <hi>Is not thy iniquity</hi> (already) <hi>great, and thy wickedneſs infinite?</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 22.5. Great for the nature of thy ſins, and infinite for their number; and wilt thou like one that is preſſing to death, cry and call for more weight.</p>
               <p>Maintain thy power and authority in thy Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: A wiſe, grave carriage will ſharpen the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of reproof, and make it pierce the deeper. Fooliſh familiarity blunteth the edge of it. He that would throw a ſtone forcibly to do execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt ſtand at ſome diſtance.</p>
               <p>Encourage ſmall beginnings of good in any in thy family: Shine with a lightſome countenance, caſt a warm influence upon the bloſſoms of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hereby thou mayeſt do much towards their ripening. <hi>Davids</hi> eye of favour was upon the faithful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6. A Governor of a family muſt like a Gardener, pluck up weeds, but cheriſh and tender the good flowers and plants.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Take care that all in thy Family be well employed:</hi> Not to permit idleneſs in thy houſe, is one way to prevent ungodlineſs. There is
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:172730:302"/>employment ſuitable to every perſon in thy dwelling: Servants ſhould be diligent in the diſcharge of their duties: <hi>Jobs</hi> Servants were about their work, when the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> fell upon them, and ſent them into the other World, <hi>Job</hi> 1.14, 17. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved his Maſter <hi>Laban</hi> with all his might, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. and 5. <hi>Apelles</hi> painted a Servant with <hi>Hindes feet</hi> (to ſhew that he ſhould be nimble in diſpatching any errand) with <hi>broad ſhoulders</hi> (ſignifying, that he ſhould contentedly bear hard uſage) and with his <hi>hands full of tools,</hi> becauſe he ſhould be always at work. Children alſo (if at home) muſt be employed in their places; if young, in Learning; if elder, in ſome Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<note place="margin">Plutarch in vita.</note> 
                  <hi>Solon</hi> the Athenian Law-giver enacted, That the Son ſhould not relieve his Father in his old age, who had brought him up idle, and without a trade. The Patriarchs, though prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal men in their Generation, brought up all their Children to ſome Calling; their tender Daughters were not exempted from Houſhold buſineſs: <hi>Rebeccah</hi> (the Mother of Prophets and Princes) was not aſhamed of her Pitcher, and drawing water therewith for her Fathers Cattel.</p>
               <p>Thoſe dainty Dames who plead her pattern for their ear-rings and bracelets, will hardly plead it for a pitcher and painfulneſs. <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> brought up his daughters in Carding and Spinning. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men though they are not bound to bring up their Children to low or mean callings, yet are bound to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:172730:302"/>keep them out of the ſnare of idleneſs, and to take care that they be in ſome lawful buſineſs, ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to themſelves and others. The Wife as well as Servants and Children ought to be induſtrious in her ſtation. <hi>Spinſter</hi> is a term given to the greateſt woman in our Law. It is ſaid of the good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, <hi>She ſeeketh Wool and Flax, and worketh willingly with her hands, ſhe looketh well to the ways of her houſhold, and eateth not the bread of idleneſs,</hi> Pro. 31.13, 27. A Womanswork conſiſteth in ſowing and doing ſomwhat her ſelf, and overſeeing others, as appeareth in the forequoted place, beſides the charge of her children; hereby a wiſe woman is ſaid <hi>to build her houſe,</hi> Pro. 14.1. As a Carpenter layeth the plat-form of an houſe in his head, and ſo ſtudieth that none of his ſtuff be cut to waſte; So a good Houſewife doth ſo overlook the affairs of her family, and ſo contrive and order things by a prudent provident forecaſt, that there may be no waſte, but all things diſpoſed for the beſt. Hence it is that though the Husband is called the <hi>guide of the Wife,</hi> yet the Wife is called the <hi>guide of the Houſe,</hi> Pro. 2.17. 1 Tim. 5.14. And for this end they are commanded to be keepers at home, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. They that gad much abroad, do their families at home but little good; ſuch are according to the ſignification of the ſecond Wife of <hi>Lamech, Zillah's, the ſhadows</hi> of Wives; The Grecians had a cuſtom when the new married Bride was brought home to her Husbands houſe, to burn the Axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the Chariot or Cart in which ſhe was brought, before the door; to teach her that ſhe
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:172730:303"/>muſt <hi>abide at home.</hi> But the main work lyeth upon the governour of the Family; <hi>Be thou diligent to know the ſtate of thy flock, and look well to thy herds,</hi> Pro. 27.23. He that is far from his work, is not far from want. The Jews have a Proverb <hi>The Maſters foot makes his ground fat;</hi> which ſpeaks thus much, that if the Maſter be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his own hands, all things will go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his houſe.

               <p>Truely Satan hath a mighty advantage againſt an Idle and a brawling family; As the Dog, he devoureth the ſheep in peices, which he could not do whole.

               <p>But I muſt eſpecially commend this duty to the governours of families, <hi>Husbands and Wives.</hi> Children are ſeldom ſo impudent, and ſervants may either be made quiet within, or be turned out of doors; but if the chief ſtrings jar all the melody is marr'd. Obſerve how the Holy Ghoſt giveth this particular precept, in order to the promotion of piety in a family; The Wife muſt be of a meek <hi>and quiet ſpirit,</hi> and the Husband muſt <hi>give honour to the Wife as unto the weaker Veſſel, as heirs together of the grace of life, that prayers be not hindered,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4, 7. We may conſider the <hi>injunction,</hi> and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of it; the <hi>injunction</hi> is firſt to <hi>Wives,</hi> They muſt be of meek and quiet ſpirits; quiet not quarrelſom, meek not murmuring through peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or mad with paſſion. A contentious wife is a continual dropping, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 19.13. The man would ſtay at home, but her tongue like rain dropping through the roof upon his head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſitteth down, drives him out of his houſe. Where is godlineſs in the mean time? The wiſe man ſaith again, <hi>Its better to dwell in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> (amongſt venemous creatures) <hi>then with ſuch a Wife,</hi> Pro. 21.13. when ſhe ſhould be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe is like a mad Dog barking or biting. Such a Wife, ſaith <hi>Lycophron,</hi> is but a <hi>cold armful.</hi> This made <hi>Sylla</hi> ſay, <hi>I had been bleſſed if I had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a Batchelor.</hi> Upon this ground I ſuppoſe <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate (whoſe mouth was often black with blaſphemies) ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtead of <hi>meet-help,</hi> might have written <hi>meet-hinderer.</hi> But certainly whatſoever ſome mens perverſneſs may drivel
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:172730:305"/>and utter, or ſome womens peeviſhneſs occaſion, a woman, if of a godly and quiet ſpirit, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt comfort on earth, and a great help ſhe may be to her Husband in his journey to Heaven. The <hi>Injunction</hi> is ſecondly to the <hi>Husband;</hi> he muſt <hi>honor his Wife as the weaker veſſel,</hi> as his <hi>fellow-heir of the grace of life:</hi> He muſt <hi>honor</hi> her, not be bitter to her: He muſt give her his greateſt love, not deny her a good look. Some Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are ſo Currriſh and Crabbed, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways raging and fretting at their Wives, nay, like thoſe that are diſtracted, they ſometimes beat and tear their Wives, themſelves; <hi>For they two are one fleſh:</hi> How far are ſuch from obedience to Gods Law? Let the Husband <hi>honor the Wife as the weaker veſſel,</hi> that is, uſe her tenderly: <hi>China</hi> diſhes, and <hi>Venice</hi> glaſſes muſt be tenderly handled, becauſe they are weak veſſels. The Husband muſt with the mantle of love, cover many infirmities: An Heathen could tell <hi>Sarah,</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>covering of the eyes to her,</hi> Gen. 20.16. The eye is the tendereſt part of the body; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a ſpecial cover to fence it. When God would ſpeak his infinite reſpect to, and care of his people, he ſaith, They are as dear to him <hi>as the apple of his eye.</hi> Truly, Husbands ought to be as tender of their Wives, as of the <hi>apple of their eyes.</hi> But Reader, ſee the reaſon of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of love to Husbands and Wives, <hi>That your prayers be not hindred;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Winde up thoſe weights of meekneſs and love, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will ſtand ſtill: Take away thoſe needful
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:172730:306"/>props, and piety will fall to the ground. O friend, as thou haſt any love to the honor of God, honor thy Wife as the weaker veſſel, if God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to that relation: If thou art a Wife, be of a meek and quiet ſpirit. If there be not concord in affections, there will be ſad diſcord in petitions. When there is War in a Kingdom, how are Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths prophaned, Ordinances deſpiſed, Prayer and Scripture neglected? men are hurried away in haſte to this and that place, and leave duties behinde them: So in a family, which is a Kingdom in a little volume, Diviſions will put Religion behinde, and force it to ſtand back. <hi>Rubenius Celer</hi> would needs have it engraven on his Tomb, that he had lived with his Wife <hi>Ennea</hi> forty three years, and eight moneths, and yet they never fell out.</p>
               <p>It is happy where the Husband and Wife are like the two branches in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hand, ſo cloſed together in one bark, that both made but one piece: or like <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, They both lived but one life; and where the whole family, like the multitude of Believers, is <hi>of one accord, of one heart, and of one ſoul in the Lord,</hi> Acts 4.32. with the encreaſe of God.</p>
               <p>I have now diſpatched what I intended to offer thee, for the advancement of Godlineſs in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: If thou art a ſtranger to this honorable, comfortable work of worſhipping God in, and with thy Family; O that I could prevail with thee to put the counſel of God ſpeedily into practice! I muſt aſſure thee from the Living and Almighty God, That thou art accountable to the Judge of
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:172730:306"/>quick and dead, for all the ſouls in thy Family; God hath the chief propriety in every perſon in thy dwelling. As the flock which <hi>Jacob</hi> looked after was <hi>Labans;</hi> ſo the family which thou haſt the overſight of, is Gods: <hi>Thy ſons and thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which thou haſt born to me,</hi> Ezek. 16.20.

<note place="margin">Gen. 39.43.</note> and theſe daughters are my daughters, and theſe ſervants are my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and all that thou ſeeſt is mine.</hi> Indeed God doth in effect ſay to thee, what <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did to <hi>Moſes</hi> Mother, <hi>Take this childe, and nurſe it for me, and I will give thee thy wages,</hi> Exod. 2.9. <hi>Take this Son, this Daughter, and nurſe them for me, in my nurture and admonition: Take this man-ſervant, this maid-ſervant, and bring them up for me, in my fear and ſervice; and I will give thee an eternal reward.</hi> Friend, thou wouldſt be faithful in bringing up Children or Servants for thy Brother or Soveraign; and wilt thou be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in bringing up Sons and Servants to thy God and Saviour? Is it fit that Gods ſervants ſhould do the Devils work? Let Conſcience judge. Did God give thee them to be brought up in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſwearing, or lying, or Atheiſm; or like ſo many Heathen, or Beaſts, without any knowledge of his Word and Will? Did he honor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt thee with their education, to have thee poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their ſouls by thy irreligious pattern, and ſtarve their ſouls by not giving them ſpiritual food? Is this thy love to thy Maker and Redeemer?</p>
               <p>Beſides, I muſt tell thee, As <hi>Jacob</hi> was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:172730:307"/>to <hi>Laban</hi> for the whole flock; if any were torn by beaſts, or ſtollen by day or night, he bore the loſs of all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.39. <hi>Of his hands it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:</hi> So art thou anſwerable to God for every one in thy Family; if any one be devoured and torn in pieces by the roaring Lyon the Devil, through thy negligence, God will require his ſoul at thy hands.</p>
               <p>O Reader, conſider, Death will ſhortly break up thine houſe, when thy children and ſervants muſt go to everlaſting fire, if they dye without grace, and the knowledge and fear of God. If thou art now care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about the eternal good of thy children and ſervants, that they periſh for ever, through thy falſeneſs and unfaithfulneſs, how dreadful will thy account be? What wilt thou do, when the blood of their ſouls ſhall be required of thee? If Chriſt ſentence men to Hell, for not viſiting ſick and impriſoned bodies, for not feeding hungry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; what ſentence will he paſs on thee, for not viſiting thoſe ſouls committed to thy charge, which were impriſoned by the Devil, and ſick unto death; and for not giving them the bread of life, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to ſtarve and dye?</p>
               <p>If on him that brought a temporal death on <hi>Cain,</hi> vengeance ſhould be taken ſevenfold; what vengeance ſhall be taken on thee who tumbleſt others into eternal death? Believe it, Reader, theſe are no jeſting things: If therefore thou haſt any bowels towards the children of thine own body; if thou haſt any compaſſion towards thy poor ſervants, whom Chriſt thought worth his
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:172730:307"/>own blood; if thou haſt any love to thy deareſt Saviour, or thine own everlaſting ſalvation; if thou would leave this withering World with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and look into the other World with courage, exerciſe thy ſelf to godlineſs in thy family, obey the particulars for that end commanded thee by the infinite God; do thine utmoſt that all of thy family, may be of the family of Faith; and all of thine houſhold, may belong to <hi>the houſhold of God;</hi> that ſo when the King of Terrors ſhall give a diſcharge from all relations, thou mayeſt with thy family be tranſlated from living together in one Houſe, to dwell for ever in one Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Reader, Thou mayeſt perceive in the cloſe of the tenth Chapter, that much more is promiſed then I have in this Treatiſe performed; the payment of which, though I do at preſent defer, yet through the ſtrength of Chriſt, I ſhall not deny. If thou haſt any intereſt at the Throne of Grace, I do earneſtly deſire thy prayers, that this part may finde acceptance with the Saints, and be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for the advantage of many ſouls; and that in the other part I may receive much aſſiſtance from the bleſſed Saviour; thereby I ſhall be the more enabled to be ſerviceable to thine and others ſalvations.</p>
